            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here be two Idols ſet up among our Brain-ſick People, which muſt be broken down, <hi>viz.</hi> LIBERTY OF CONSCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ENCE and TOLERATION. Under the Name and Colour of the firſt, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſet up their miſled Perſwaſion for a Law, and ſo ſin without poſſibility of any ſenſe of <hi>Guilt</hi> or <hi>Conviction.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:102499:3"/>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Under the Name of Goſpel <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, gentleneſs</hi> and <hi>peacableneſs,</hi> they cry up <hi>TOLERATION</hi> and <hi>IMPUNITY,</hi> and ſo are without fear to add ſin to ſin, when in no danger of a ſubſequent puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Theſe, if ſuffered and countenanced, will in time overthrow <hi>RELIGION</hi> and <hi>GO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERNMENT,</hi> which are the pillars and ſupport of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> both in Church and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>To encounter and remove theſe two great obſtacles of our <hi>Happineſs,</hi> my deſign hath been in this little Treatiſe to aſſert and prove two things; 1. <hi>That there muſt be juſt Laws eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in every Society, to limit the</hi> Conſcience <hi>of the Chriſtian and Rational man, and that whoſoever tranſgreſſeth thoſe Laws is guilty of ſin, notwithſtanding any plea of Conſcience, which can give no licenſe for any man to ſin.</hi> 2. <hi>That</hi> Puniſhments, <hi>by Goſpel Rules, are neceſſarily inflicted upon obſtinate Offenders, and that</hi> Toleration <hi>and</hi> Impunity <hi>are of dangerous conſequence to our King, Church, and whole Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reaſons are many that induced me to dedicate theſe weak Meditations to Your protection, my good <hi>Pious Lord,</hi> as that I might lay hold on the firſt opportunity of manifeſting that juſt Obſervance Your <hi>worth</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:102499:3"/>and <hi>dignity,</hi> as well as your <hi>favour,</hi> have chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged and extracted from me. And, becauſe honoured with the Title of being Your <hi>Son,</hi> I accounted my ſelf in duty obliged to give you ſome aſſurance of the ſoundneſs of my <hi>Judgment,</hi> and ſtedfaſtneſs of my <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> firmly aſſenting and adhering to the right exerciſe of the beſt Religion, and the beſt Government under Heaven, which muſt tend not only to my own credit, but Your content and ſatisfaction. And my Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition is to give Teſtimony of ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to be in me to ſuch a Father, whoſe zeal and ability to defend the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> is eminently known to a great part of the World. And verily, it is but common prudence for my own ſecurity to provide ſuch a Patron as You are, to aſſiſt me in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending a Noble Argument, which though full of <hi>Truth, Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> fit to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, yet in probability can no ſooner be drawn out but it muſt expect to meet with much oppoſition.</p>
            <p>Yet this gives me encouragement, that while under your Banners though I expect many Gainſayers, yet I can fear no Confuters. If I ſhould fall it will be honourably, yet I dare promiſe my ſelf to come off victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. And under Your conduct I cannot
<pb facs="tcp:102499:4"/>but aſſume freſh Courage, if called upon far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to maintain the <hi>Faith</hi> of the Goſpel, the <hi>uniform Worſhip</hi> of God, the <hi>Government</hi> both in Laws and Penalties juſtly fixed and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt <hi>Recuſancy,</hi> which will certainly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the <hi>order, peace</hi> and <hi>welfare</hi> of our whole Society.</p>
            <p>My prayers and endeavours are intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe things, and ſo long as I continue ſtedfaſt in thoſe Deſigns and Attempts, I hope You will not account me unworthy to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my ſelf, as the Churches, ſo</p>

                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:102499:6"/>
                  <p>If they be <hi>Inanimate Creatures,</hi> that move un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wittingly, and yet conſtantly, as the <hi>Heavens</hi> and <hi>Elements. The</hi> Sun <hi>knoweth its riſing, and the</hi> Moon <hi>its going down:</hi> The <hi>Stars</hi> keep their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the <hi>Orbes</hi> their Rotations, according to Gods Ordinance or Decree they all move, as the Divine wiſdom orders them.</p>
                  <p>If they be <hi>Animate Creatures,</hi> that have, though weak, yet ſome underſtanding, they move from the moſt perfect principle they have, to ſeek their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and ſatisfaction; To gratifie their <hi>ſenſes</hi> is their utmoſt aim.</p>
                  <p>And if they be <hi>voluntary Agents,</hi> that clearly apprehend what they do, yet kept they are as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined in one conſtant tenure and courſe of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according to the eſtabliſhment of Natures law. And this innate obedience to the <hi>law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> as God hath ordered, is the ſtay, the ballaſt of the whole World, that Gods Creatures cannot naturally or ordinarily do otherwiſe, than to ſhew themſelves apt and inclineable to this innate Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>MAN,</hi> that hath a <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>immortal Soul,</hi> and ſo a more noble Principle, and hath more excellent endowments and perfections than the reſt of <hi>viſible Creatures,</hi> muſt aim at nobler Ends, attainable by thoſe <hi>faculties</hi> and <hi>abilities</hi> with which God of his goodneſs hath extraordinarily bleſt him. So, that to gratifie the <hi>ſenſe</hi> cannot be his utmoſt aim, but to content the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is attainable by <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and her improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, directing him to thoſe Actions that may conduct and lead him the readieſt way to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102499:6"/>the enjoying that <hi>Happineſs</hi> which is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>So that <hi>Man</hi> acts moſt naturally when he acts moſt rationally; when, by that noble principle of humane actions, his <hi>Spirit,</hi> he inquires, ſearcheth, diſcerneth, judgeth and elects fit and ſuitable Means directly tending to that ultimate End, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>content</hi> and <hi>acquieſcency,</hi> unto which he aſpires and inclines. So the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Man is the <hi>Candle</hi> of the Lord ſet up in his Superiour part, to direct Mans goings in the <hi>night</hi> of this World, and <hi>to guide his feet in the way of peace.</hi> So, upon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſive Reaſoning, to chooſe and approve of the moſt plain way, and moſt direct means, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him to his deſigned end of <hi>content,</hi> muſt be granted to be the <hi>Nature of Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the Laws of <hi>Mens Natures</hi> are the reſults and laſt concluſions of the <hi>Spirits</hi> practical Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. The dictates of the <hi>Intellective part</hi> pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially limiting, directing and ordering mans Actions, as they moſt probably move in a ſtreight tendency to their ultimate End, are the <hi>Laws of Nature</hi> in Men. Now <hi>Man</hi> is to conſider himſelf in a double reſpect, privately, ſingly or diſtinct from company, and rationally is to mind his actions for his particular <hi>peace;</hi> or publickly, as intereſſed in humane Society, and to order things rationally for its <hi>general good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For internal, ſecret Actions, that tend to every ſingle mans particular <hi>content,</hi> a mans own <hi>Reaſon</hi> may be ſupream Judge, and give Laws and Rules for his direction. In ſuch caſes we allow every man the judgment of his own <hi>Diſcretion.</hi> But for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102499:7"/>open and external Action in our Converſations, as relating to <hi>Society,</hi> for regulating them every man is not a competent Judge. That's Natural, <hi>Quod convenit cum natura ſociali &amp; rationali.</hi> It's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for Man related to a <hi>Society,</hi> to ſubmit to the juſt determinations of his <hi>Governours,</hi> whoſe wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom knows to order what is beſt and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to <hi>Publick peace,</hi> which by reaſon in this laſt Circumſtance he is bound to preſerve and maintain. And yet, then alſo private Men move naturally in a direct tendency to their own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar happineſs, when they diſcharge thoſe duties of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Kindneſs</hi> that preſerve peace to their Neighbours, to which they are obliged; and they by it create a content and delight in their own <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> which naturally muſt be ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>They erre dangerouſly that think, and ſay, <hi>That becauſe they have a Law from their</hi> Reaſon, <hi>within their ſelves, for their own private and ſecret Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that their own Reaſon may give directions for publick Actions that concern their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Laws therefore of Mans nature, that direct mens external Actions to promote the peace and welfare of <hi>Humane ſociety,</hi> are not Mens private particular Judgments, but Governours ſober and deliberate determinations.</p>
                  <p>For if every Mans particular Judgment were his natural Law in <hi>Publick</hi> Concerns, what could be expected, but from different and contrary Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, there would be different and contrary Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Actions, a renting into Diviſions and Diſſenſions, and an irreparable breach there would
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102499:7"/>be of <hi>peace,</hi> which is the main end of <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Society.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that if <hi>Subjects</hi> will move naturally and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally in a ſetled Society, they are to account the juſt and ſober Conſtitutions of their wiſe <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> to be the Laws of their Natures to direct them for Peace, to which they are bound naturally to conform. <hi>Juſt Conſtitutions,</hi> I ſay. For neither power, greatneſs nor multitude, countenancing or maintaining diſordered Actions, can make them natural to men, but only their conſonancy to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and tendency to a good End. And ſo it is not, what hath been done, or what is generally done through <hi>ſenſe, paſſion</hi> or <hi>cuſtome;</hi> but, what ought, may and hath been done upon ſober, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate <hi>Reaſon,</hi> is to be accounted natural to man.</p>
                  <p>And, if we conſider, we muſt acknowledge that very oft <hi>prejudice, education, paſſion, cuſtome</hi> and <hi>intereſt,</hi> hath perverted the Reaſon of <hi>Governours,</hi> but theſe things ought not to be thrown as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon <hi>Humane Nature.</hi> He ſaies true that ſaies, <hi>Hony is ſweet,</hi> though ſick men think it not ſo. It is not to be reputed the <hi>Nature</hi> of men, but <hi>corruption</hi> of Nature, when numbers of men chooſe or determine any thing <hi>impious</hi> or <hi>unjuſt.</hi> It is not <hi>Humane Reaſon,</hi> but the <hi>depravation</hi> of it that dictates and concludes practically of any thing that is <hi>filthy</hi> or <hi>diſhoneſt.</hi> For they act not rationally that erect not proper means, nor humanely that fix not in a right end, that is, the <hi>publick good</hi> of the Community in which they are intereſſed and concerned.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:102499:8"/>
                  <p>From our <hi>paper Hectors</hi> and <hi>whifflers</hi> for <hi>Humane Reaſon,</hi> although I hear much of the noiſe, I can ſee very little of the thing in them; For not aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the end of <hi>Society</hi> they ceaſe to be <hi>humane,</hi> and not chooſing the Means and Rules to the <hi>End,</hi> which is the right ordering of publick Actions, they ceaſe to be rational and prudential.</p>
                  <p>So the dictates and concluſions of the ſober diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſive Reaſon of <hi>Governours,</hi> deliberately directing and chooſing fit means to compaſs the deſigned End of <hi>Societies</hi> peace and full content, are to be concluded the Laws of <hi>Mens Nature</hi> in relation to their Societies, by <hi>Governours</hi> to be eſtabliſhed, and by <hi>Subjects</hi> naturally to be ſubmitted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
                  <p>And thus alſo we muſt determine, if we will conſiderately be directed by the Rules of the Goſpel.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. GOD, who made <hi>Man,</hi> of his free Grace, the perfecteſt of all viſible Creatures, and capable of greater Happineſs, hath given him greater endowment and ability by which that <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> might be attainable. And therefore hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and placed the <hi>Intellective faculty,</hi> as the <hi>Sun,</hi> in the heavenly part of that Microcoſme, by whoſe clear dictates, as ſo many radiant emanations of light, Man may walk ſafely and guide himſelf. But, by the unlucky interpoſition of <hi>Earthly delight, Senſe, Paſſion</hi> or <hi>Cuſtome,</hi> this glorious Light of Heaven, from time to time, hath ſuffered Eclipſes; and Men too frequently, like Beaſts in a Wilderneſs, have wandred out of the Way, and have found no full content to reſt in.</p>
                  <p>But evident it is, Our Gracious God, who knew not to take off utterly his Loving kindneſs from man, nor ſuffered his Care of him to fail, out of a tender regard to his ſafety, hath, at ſundry times and in divers manners, given Men the light of his <hi>Word,</hi> and hath openly from time to time declared, <hi>That he would have</hi> Man <hi>come to the knowledge of Truth and be ſaved.</hi> And therefore he, who out of his great love, <hi>ſpake to our Fathers by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, hath in theſe laſt daies ſpoken to us by his Son,</hi> whom he ſent from his boſom to reveal this good Will of his, to transform Mankind by <hi>renewing the Spirits of their minds, while they approved the good and acceptable Will of God;</hi> and this is rightly called the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:102499:9"/>
                  <p>So, the <hi>Will</hi> of God in this laſt diſpenſation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and publiſhed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, is that which we underſtand by the Goſpel; and this is no more than the good News of a <hi>poſſible Happineſs</hi> for Man, and the Rules to be obſerved by which that Happineſs is attainable.</p>
                  <p>Now this, I humbly conceive, is the beſt and moſt warrantable Notion we can have of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>That it is a form of Government which Chriſt hath left to the World, for thoſe that would be of his Church and People, That by agreement of ſubmiſſion to thoſe Rules preſcribed, a Company of faithful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors might perfectly joyn themſelves together into a comfortable Society and Communion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For Man is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a Creature given to <hi>Society,</hi> fitted by nature, and by his ingenious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is inclined to it. Now every Company or Society which is neceſſary for the well-being of Man, muſt, for that end, have a frame of Polity, a model of Government from juſt Laws, delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately agreed upon, and wiſely conſtituted and ſet over it. And theſe things which are in every wiſe Government, are eminently conſpicuous in the Goſpel, which is undoubtedly the beſt frame of Government in the World.</p>
                  <p>So were thoſe Inſpired Authors perſwaded, that wrote the <hi>Canonical Epiſtles</hi> to the ſeveral Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches after Chriſts Aſcenſion, and 'tis clearly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in that profound Epiſtle written to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews at Jeruſalem.</hi> For at that time when that Epiſtle was written, there were two famous Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments that ſtood in Competition for <hi>precedence</hi> in that place: <hi>The Old Law, or</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Polity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102499:9"/>by</hi> Moſes <hi>to the</hi> Iſraelites; <hi>and the New Law, which is the Goſpel given by</hi> Chriſt <hi>unto Believers.</hi> And our Holy Author in that Epiſtle, makes it his buſineſs to prove, <hi>That the Goſpel delivered by Chriſt was juſtly to be preferred before the Law, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by</hi> Moſes; <hi>and that, as Chriſt, ſo did his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in all things deſerve the preheminence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Church</hi> then is a Society of the Faithful, and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is to be looked upon as the model of Government which Chriſt left his Church. Every Believer then muſt not only look on the Priviledges and Mercies, promiſed and exhibited in the Goſpel, as the ground of his confidence; but on the Laws enjoyned in the Goſpel, as juſt and wiſe Rules, directive of his obedience. And we cannot but obſerve, that the Promiſes of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are not abſolute but conditional, upon our Faith and Obedience to the Rules preſcribed, <hi>if we love him and keep his Commandments.</hi> Which, till we do heed and obſerve, we will be too favourable to the ſpawn of the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> thoſe Libertines that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply and thrive in the midſt of us, who looking on the Goſpel as a Promiſe of <hi>Merey,</hi> and not as a Rule of <hi>Duty,</hi> turn the <hi>Grace of God into wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>continue in ſin</hi> ſecurcly, <hi>becauſe Grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds,</hi> which <hi>God forbid.</hi> When <hi>Chriſt is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of eternal Salvation to all them that obey the Goſpel,</hi> Heb. 5.9. <hi>And they that walk according to this Rule,</hi> they may look for that <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> which is promiſed to the <hi>Iſrael of God.</hi> Gal. 6.</p>
                  <p>So the <hi>Will</hi> of God under this laſt diſpenſation manifeſted and publiſhed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102499:10"/>is, that which we underſtand by the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Now of things thus manifeſted ſome are <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,</hi> great myſteries of Godlineſs, that <hi>Angels deſred to</hi> peep <hi>into,</hi> thoſe perſpicacious intelligences were glad to behold; Things the Wiſe men of <hi>this World</hi> did not know, <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> could not diſcover, but contrived they were by the manifold wiſdom of God, and publiſhed of his infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by his Son, who hath kept nothing ſecret of the Counſel of his Will, but hath declared what is neceſſary for us and our Salvation. And unto theſe Objects, <hi>Supernatural,</hi> we are to make our application by Faith and Hope. And from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, I ſuppoſe, our applying our ſelves by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and relying on them, are called and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>ſupernatural</hi> alſo. Although certainly, we have reaſon enough to aſſent to theſe things as true, and rely on them, and rejoyce in them as good, which our gracious God, who is truth and cannot lye, of infallible veracity hath clearly manifeſted by his Son, and his immenſe goodneſs inclined him, to reveal by him what he ſaw was neceſſary for our Salvation, and we are to apply our ſelves in reaſon to them accordingly.</p>
                  <p>But ſome things are <hi>Natural,</hi> ſuch as by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of Reaſon may be diſcerned and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; as, That <hi>God, the firſt infinite Being, is a Spirit,</hi> that <hi>he is but One, and to be worſhipped, &amp;c.</hi> That <hi>our Neighbour is to be loved, edified, comforted, and what we would that others, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Chriſt came not to deſtroy this Law, but to fulfil it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Rules, <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Rational,</hi> are afreſh eſtabliſhed by Chriſt in his laſt diſpenſation, and by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102499:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>a new publication revived for Morality, and mens comfortable Converſations. Theſe are reaſonably called <hi>the Rules of the Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Goſpel, as well as our Treatiſe, reſpects not only <hi>ſingle perſons</hi> but <hi>Societies,</hi> and ſeveral directions are given by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, for ordering mens Converſations in Societies for publick good.</p>
                  <p>To ſhew that Governours by theſe Rules muſt be appointed over Societies, is the next conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. NO ſooner could Mankind multiply unto that number that might admit of <hi>Society</hi> or <hi>Communion,</hi> but had they continued in a ſtate of <hi>Innocence,</hi> Superiority and Inferiority, Dominion and Subjection would have been found amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt Father of all Mankind, from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of Nature and Exiſtence, from power, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and experience that was eminently in him, from the protection his Poſterity had from him, and their dependance upon him, had been abſolute Monarch, Ruler and Judge over all that deſcended from him. And with this Authority of Rule <hi>Cain</hi> was inveſted, when <hi>Abels</hi> deſires were to be towards him, and <hi>Cain</hi> was to Rule over him. And when in every Family there is a Guide, one
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102499:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>Father, one Maſter to be honoured and obeyed. That in many Families united in Society there ſhould be one ſupream Moderator to Rule, is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>And that cannot be unlawful among Men on Earth, which God hath revealed to be among the Angels in Heaven, where there are <hi>Thrones, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, Powers</hi> and <hi>Dominions.</hi> The higheſt in the Order ruling ſubordinately under God, without Tyrannical inſulting, and the loweſt Subject, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out murmuring or oppoſing. <hi>Regere &amp; Regi neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarium eſt,</hi> To Govern and be Governed is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and natural. Neither <hi>beauty</hi> nor <hi>being</hi> of this Glorious Univerſe could ſubſiſt or continue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Order, unleſs ſome part did Rule and ſome Obey, unleſs one were Chief to Command others that belong to it.</p>
                  <p>Conſider that the God of <hi>Nature</hi> hath thus ordered every thing. In our <hi>Bodies,</hi> One head over the members; In our <hi>Souls,</hi> One underſtanding over the other faculties. In the <hi>viſible Heavens,</hi> One Sun in the Firmament over all the Stars. Over the whole ſyſteme of Creatures, Heaven and Earth, viſible and inviſible, One <hi>GOD</hi> ruleth over all.</p>
                  <p>And if no Superiority were ſetled over a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany aſſociated by Heirſhip or Deſcent, of neceſſity there muſt be <hi>Rulers</hi> elected and <hi>Judges</hi> appointed to determine Controverſies, and preſerve Peace, without which the happineſs and welfare of the Society could never be promoted. For if every mans Opinion or Will were ſuffered arbitrarily to be his Law, when every man from the pride of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102499:11"/>his heart, and ambition of Precedence, is inclined pertinaciouſly to adhere, and unyieldingly to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his miſ-led Perſwaſion, and is prone by all means to bring others to ſubmit unto him. If none were appointed (whoſe <hi>wiſdom</hi> were not to be doubted, nor <hi>goodneſs</hi> nor <hi>juſtice</hi> ſuſpected, nor <hi>Authority</hi> to be oppoſed or gainſayed) by whoſe determination, judgment and order, the People were to abide by, what could follow from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety</hi> of Perſwaſions but <hi>diviſions,</hi> what could ſucceed but a <hi>diſſolution</hi> of that Peace and Unity which is the ſure wall of defence, to ſupport and maintain the whole ſuperſtructure of additional Comforts, which are neceſſary for the welfare of the whole Society, what can be expected but <hi>rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> into ſeveral Parties and Factions, and there muſt unluckily ſucceed a diſorderly <hi>Chaos</hi> and confuſion, and every evil work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rulers then muſt of neceſſity be appointed, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Controverſie and ſettle Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> muſt be appointed over every Society for <hi>Peace</hi> ſake, ſo muſt ſuch alſo be appointed for <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> ſake.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Diſtributive Juſtice</hi> is the glory, exaltation, the ſtay, the preſervation of any Nation.</p>
                  <p>Now diſtributive Juſtice is, <hi>to render to every man according to the merit of his Work;</hi> that he that doth well might have encouragement by due Reward, and he that doth ill might be diſcouraged by proportionable Puniſhments: That there be a right Sentence, and care of a due Execution.</p>
                  <p>Now if no third Perſon, or Order of men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned, were agreed upon and conſtituted as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102499:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſupream Judges to determine the <hi>merit</hi> and <hi>quality</hi> of Private mens Actions, and the meaſure of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments</hi> that did in equity belong to them; We ſee how every man for himſelf, if he hath done well, is ready to overvalue his Merit, and extend the meaſure of Reward to himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a due proportion; and if he hath done ill, to extenuate if not excuſe his own Irregularity, and to mitigate if not exempt his Puniſhment. And for his <hi>Neighbour,</hi> every man is ready to extenuate his Merit and leſſen his Reward, to heighten his Crime and aggravate his Puniſhment. So 'tis very improbable, either for himſelf or others, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>diſtributive Juſtice</hi> men ſhould paſs a right Sentence or due Execution.</p>
                  <p>This being clear to every mans Reaſon, <hi>That a parity is not to be allowed, but</hi> Rulers <hi>and</hi> Judges <hi>muſt be appointed over every Society, as well to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Peace as to maintain Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to the conviction of this Truth by their <hi>practice,</hi> all Nations that have aſſociated, have ſubſcribed and have declared their Aſſent to the conveniency and neceſſity of it, by the management of their Concerns: And, <hi>Generalis conſuetudo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarat inſtitutum Naturae;</hi> For never any City or People, aſſociated, but conſtituted their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and ſome as Supream; nor ſent abroad an Army but appointed their General. The thriving <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi> were never in any notable ſtreight, but <hi>Trepidi ad Dictatorem confugiunt,</hi> as their chief Remedy and Security. And never was there any tumultuous Rabble of <hi>ſeditious Perſons,</hi> united upon wicked deſigns, that could in reaſon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102499:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſuppoſe they could ſubſiſt in carrying on their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked undertakings, in acting for a lawleſs Liberty or Licentiouſneſs, but they alway appointed a <hi>Captain</hi> or <hi>Leader,</hi> to whoſe Command and Conduct they did alwaies ſubmit, when they had made Choice of him to be Supream in any Enterprize that they deſired to be ſucceſsful; and owned him to be ſo.</p>
                  <p>To Conclude this point then, let it ſtand as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable, <hi>That every man that loves his Life, deſires it may be Comfortable, and ſeeks his preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and welfare.</hi> And a Comfortable life to prevent evil and promote good, is to be maintained by <hi>Society,</hi> which cannot be compaſſed by ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity or ſeparation. Neither could I ever read or hear, that ever any <hi>Society</hi> did in reaſon think or conclude to ſubſiſt and paſs a quiet and comfortable Life, without the appointment of <hi>Governours</hi> among them.</p>
                  <p>Thus by light of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and her Dictates, by <hi>Nature</hi> and her Laws, it is manifeſt that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing of <hi>Governours</hi> over every Society is both neceſſary and convenient, and this will be more fully cleared and illuſtrated, when we conſider it is approved by the Revealed Will of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> was a King over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and a Judge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by God, <hi>by whom Kings</hi> did <hi>reign, and Princes</hi> did <hi>decree juſtice.</hi> And where no Governours were there the People did fall into confuſion, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did at that time when they had <hi>no King,</hi> but <hi>every man did what was right in his own eyes.</hi> And in the laſt diſpenſation, <hi>Caeſars</hi> Authority was owned by Chriſt, and <hi>Tribute</hi> paid to him. And ſo <hi>Pontius
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102499:13"/>Pilate, Power was given him from above.</hi> They might abuſe their Power, but their <hi>Authority</hi> was of God. And in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> time, <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> was Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>Powers</hi> were appointed of God, <hi>Rulers</hi> were Miniſters of God ſet over the People for good. Prayers were to be made unto God for them, and account was to be given unto God by them. And <hi>Humane Ordinances</hi> were to be ſubmitted unto for <hi>the Lords ſake.</hi> And this yet more evident from the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> which was to be with his Church to the end of the World, when it was and is the declared Sentence and Faith of all particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that <hi>Governours are appointed by God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, how can we but ſtand amazed at the impudence of ſome perverſe Spirits, ungoverned, unnatural Tempers that are to be found in the midſt of this crooked generation, ſuch as neither will Lead nor Drive, neither Command nor Obey, but make it their buſineſs to deſpiſe <hi>Dominions,</hi> and ſpeak evil of <hi>Dignity.</hi> That dare ſpeak and think, that <hi>Superiority</hi> in any man is unnatural, helliſh, Antichriſtian. That <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> is but the unlucky iſſue of Pride, Arrogance, and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, aſſumed by <hi>

                  <p>Certainly, it is but juſt and reaſonable that ſuch men ſhould ſuffer the puniſhments of their own Choice, and be taught to ſee the madneſs of their own deluſions, by abjuring the Realm, and baniſhed from partaking the Priviledges of a well-governed Society. Sure a City is not ſo fit for ſuch Perſons as a Priſon or a Wilderneſs, who have eſpouſed

                  <p>And it is yet more ſtrange, that any ſuch Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers ſhould be found in our Nation, where it is moſt apparent that our <hi>Governours</hi> are appointed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by God eſpecially.</p>

                  <p>But if any will wilfully ſtill oppoſe, that likes <hi>Election</hi> better than <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> let ſuch remember, There was a time when all the <hi>Tribes</hi> met (and every <hi>Tacit Conſent</hi> was then included) to chooſe Him, and to make our <hi>David,</hi> King. That he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102499:14"/>was not more Eminently born, than made <hi>Chief Ruler</hi> among us: And, that by Election as well as Succeſſion, <hi>Supremacy</hi> doth juſtly belong unto him. And Choſen HE was, prudently, freely, and by univerſal Conſent.</p>
                  <p>But other <hi>Governours</hi> we have, <hi>Inferiour</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate,</hi> appointed and allowed of by Him, which (becauſe the Church is in the Kingdom) muſt be of two ſorts, <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> and <hi>Civil,</hi> that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may live quietly, <hi>in godlineſs and honeſty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Chief of both ſorts of theſe ſubordinate <hi>Governours,</hi> He that is <hi>Supream</hi> convenes to his aſſiſtance, deliberately to <hi>conſult,</hi> and <hi>adviſe,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,</hi> both in making Laws and Execution.

                  <p>And if any <hi>Governours</hi> under Heaven can be ſaid, to be allowed and approved of by God over any Society, ours or <hi>England</hi> muſt in reaſon be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to be ſo undoubtedly; not only from their reaſonable <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> which is moſt convenient, but from that extraordinary care and love that God hath declared towards them from their Miraculous <hi>Reſtitution,</hi> which, if we conſider, cannot be ſaid

                  <p>Gods <hi>love</hi> and <hi>liking</hi> of Perſons and Nations, is more ſeen by <hi>deliverance</hi> of them, than by their <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued preſervation.</hi> He was more eminently known to be <hi>Iſraels</hi> God, by bringing them out of <hi>Egypts Bondage,</hi> and the <hi>Babyloniſh Captivity,</hi> than by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> The turning again <hi>the Captivity of Zion,</hi> muſt force the Heathen to ſay, <hi>The Lord hath done great things for them, and taken great care of them.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. GOD, in whom we live, move, and have our being, hath ſo ſweetly and wiſely diſpoſed of this Syſteme of <hi>Creatures</hi> to his own Glory, that every Creature hath a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclination and propenſity to the <hi>preſervation</hi> and <hi>welfare</hi> of its Fellow Creatures; and out of that <hi>love</hi> and <hi>propenſity</hi> they freely communicate, according to their ability, what is good and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial. And this <hi>Communicative Love</hi> is diffuſed as an active principle to cement, compact and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold every part of this admirable Structure in that glorious frame and order in which now it ſtands, ſo as every <hi>Creature</hi> ſeems to looſe of its own nature, when it ceaſeth to incline to this Natural opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For who ſo blind but muſt perceive, that amidſt Inanimate Creatures, freely and chearfully, the <hi>Sun</hi> imparts its <hi>light,</hi> the <hi>Heavens</hi> their kindly <hi>influence,</hi> the <hi>Clouds</hi> their refreſhing <hi>Rain,</hi> the <hi>Fire</hi> its <hi>warmth,</hi> the <hi>Earth</hi> its <hi>increaſe.</hi> In Senſitive Creatures, <hi>Birds</hi> and <hi>Beaſts</hi> are gracious and helpful to their <hi>fellow Creatures</hi> of the ſame ſpecies, and joyn in Company and Bodies to that end, and call their <hi>Fellows</hi> to the ſame common food, and affright them from open ſnare and danger.</p>
                  <p>But this inclination in the <hi>Creatures,</hi> receives the meaſure and limits of its activity according to the different <hi>principles, faculties</hi> and <hi>endowments</hi> they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102499:16"/>have to operate withal: So every <hi>Creature,</hi> the more perfect it is, and the more it hath of Gods likeneſs, the more it diſcovers this <hi>propenſity</hi> of <hi>activity</hi> and <hi>readineſs,</hi> to communicate what is <hi>comfortable</hi> and <hi>ſuitable</hi> to the nature of its Fellow Creatures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Man</hi> therefore, that hath moſt of <hi>Gods likeneſs</hi> hath the greateſt <hi>propenſity</hi> to this goodneſs, and is naturally addicted to ſhew it, by communicating of what is moſt beneficial to them moſt willingly, who are like <hi>God</hi> and <hi>himſelf,</hi> and are in greateſt Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to receive, and diſpoſed to make the beſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of this <hi>Communication.</hi>

                  <p>Now among Men it is to be ſuppoſed, That <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours</hi> are, or ſhould be moſt like God, <hi>who fills the Earth with his goodneſs, he openeth his hand, and fills all things living with plenteouſneſs.</hi> As <hi>Gods Deputies,</hi> they ought to be moſt ready and active, from an <hi>heavenly providence,</hi> to impart what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to them that are under them. They are not ſet up aloft like liveleſs, dead <hi>Idols,</hi> for men to gaze on, to admire and Idolize, and yet continue uſeleſs, neither ſee nor hear, nor regard nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive for the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> of others. But, as living <hi>Images,</hi> of that <hi>benificent God</hi> whom they repreſent, out of a gracious providence they are to be contriving, directing and acting for the <hi>good</hi> of them under them: <hi>praeſunt ut proſint,</hi> above and over others to <hi>benefit</hi> others, not minding their private advantage, but are elevated to have the more Heavenly influence for the publick <hi>good</hi> of the Community over which they are placed, <hi>Non Dominandi cupiditate imperant, ſed efficio conſulendi,</hi> Their office, like <hi>Shepheards,</hi>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:102499:16"/>is not barely to fleece, but to feed the Flock; <hi>Patres patriae,</hi> not only to defend and maintain the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but are to direct and order them. <hi>Miniſters of God for good,</hi> Rom. 13.4.

                  <p>OF neceſſity there muſt be <hi>Laws</hi> conſtituted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout every Company of <hi>Man</hi> that are knit into one Body; for if not <hi>reſtrained</hi> and <hi>limited,</hi> many Perſons that have more <hi>Sence</hi> than <hi>Reaſon,</hi> would wildly break out into exorbitant excurſions, and miſlead others, extravagantly, into dangerous <hi>Irregularities.</hi> A City had better be without <hi>Walls</hi> than <hi>Laws,</hi> its <hi>ſafety</hi> depends more upon the latter
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102499:17"/>than the former.

                  <p>And as <hi>Laws</hi> muſt be of neceſſity to uphold the <hi>being,</hi> ſo muſt they be to preſerve the <hi>welfare</hi> of any Society: For they afford direction and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance for <hi>humane actions;</hi> And as good take the <hi>Sun</hi> out of the Firmament as <hi>Laws</hi> out of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without which, as in a perpetual Night, men would ſtumble (if not fall) and daſh continually one upon another, and offenſively.

                  <p>He that ordered Kings to <hi>Reign,</hi> hath ordained Princes to <hi>decree Juſtice.</hi> The firſt duty and work

Therefore with the Three Children, <hi>We are not careful to anſwer the King in this matter.</hi> It's <hi>better to obey God than Man.</hi> This then we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That Laws of Rulers muſt be <hi>Juſt,</hi> and tend to a good End.</p>
                  <p>Some Laws are <hi>Natural</hi> of things or actions Natural; ſome <hi>Poſitive,</hi> of things or actions In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. Thoſe that are Natural have, <hi>Intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam vim obligatoriam,</hi> from their Equity they have an obliging vertue, if no publick poſition or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Theſe are of things or actions of their own nature either <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad,</hi> and would be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed or avoided by Reaſonable Man, and would be approved or diſallowed of a Juſt God, if he had neither commanded nor forbidden them.</p>

                  <p>Now, beſides the <hi>Ten Words</hi> God gave to <hi>Jacob,</hi> there were <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> that God gave to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when particularly he undertook the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of them, ſome <hi>Voluntary Laws,</hi> ſome <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial,</hi> ſome <hi>Judicial</hi> things injoyned, that were of their own nature neither good nor bad. But, <hi>Praecipiendo debita, vetando Deus illicita fecit,</hi> Gods Authority being uncontroulable, and his Wiſdom unqueſtionable, they were to be followed or avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as moſt convenient for that People in that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition. What was intrinſecally lawful was univerſally binding, <hi>Chriſt came not to deſtroy</hi> that <hi>Law, but to fulfil it; Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> may paſs away, but not <hi>one tittle</hi> of that <hi>Law</hi> was not to paſs away, but ought to be fulfilled. But what was <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, particular</hi> and <hi>voluntary,</hi> were Changable, and theſe had their <hi>period,</hi> ſome of them at Chriſts Paſſion, more of them at the diſſolution of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Now, as it was with <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo is it with godly <hi>Rulers</hi> and their <hi>People.</hi> There are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rules and Statutes rationally agreed upon and publiſhed, as the moſt Juſt and beſt directions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing moſt to the <hi>good</hi> of the Community where divulged; among which ſome are <hi>Natural,</hi> that are of their own nature intrinſecally good, and have an obliging nature, and would be binding as Laws of God, if no poſition, if no Conſtitution from Man, ſuch as neceſſarily indiſpenſible, neither are they to be abrogated or null'd by man, that cannot be made unjuſt by God himſelf. But, other Laws among them are <hi>poſitive</hi> and <hi>voluntary,</hi> which have their poſition from Man only, and ſo may be called
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102499:20"/>
                     <hi>Humane Ordinances,</hi> Laws of Convenience, ſuch Conſtitutions as are eſtabliſhed upon deliberation as moſt convenient, <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Grave and ſober Perſons, choſen and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for determination of ſuch things, for the peace and good of the Community wherein they live: And, <hi>Sufficit Ratio <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſalis,</hi> we are to abide by it. That a thing or action ſuitable, and in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon tending to the peace and good of the Society, ſhould be <hi>determined,</hi> and when determined ſhould be <hi>obliging.</hi> To Conclude then this particular, <hi>Lex eſt ordinatio Rationis ad bonum publicum ab eo, qui curam habet Communitatis promulgata:</hi> When ſo it is, that a Law is a right order and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Reaſon for Publick good, publiſhed from him that hath the care of the Society. And, fith ſome Laws are <hi>natural, immutable, indiſpenſable,</hi> and are fixed and determined eternally before any Conſtitution of Governours; but others are <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, temporary, mutable,</hi> that have their Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Eſtabliſhment from. Governours determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon <hi>conveniency.</hi> Theſe latter determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of indifferent things are properly called <hi>Laws of Governours.</hi> Laws and Determinations of <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> things, the Governours do but revive and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorate them; but the Laws and Determinations of <hi>Indifferent</hi> things, the Governour animates them, gives them being and eſtabliſhes them. So theſe <hi>poſitive Laws,</hi> Conſtitutions of Indifferent things, to prevent <hi>diviſion</hi> and ſettle <hi>peace,</hi> theſe are properly the Laws of Governours; and it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and neceſſary for them, to take care of ſuch <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations</hi> in their reſpective Societies; They
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102499:20"/>are Reaſonable and Juſt becauſe of things not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful: They are neceſſary becauſe they tend to Peace.</p>
                  <p>Thus it is clear, to any ſober Reaſon, <hi>That Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours ought to determine and eſtabliſh Laws, for the good of the Society in which concerned.</hi>

                  <p>That being warrantable and commendable to be done by Rulers, Gods Deputies, that was done by God and his Prophets, and by Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, who in ſeveral diſpenſations of thoſe very Rules made a new publication.

And ſoberly let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and the morality of the fifth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Rulers <hi>Authority</hi> and Subjects <hi>Obedience</hi> is plainly diſcovered, by his voluntary Submiſſion to Commands and Ordinances of this nature, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of things in their own nature indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. For if the matter be unlawful that is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by Commands of Superiours, then <hi>Daniel</hi>'s <hi>Vetitum eſt</hi> is ſufficient, <hi>We are not careful — It is better to obey God than Man.</hi> If the thing be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, thou ſerveſt thy own turn, thy own Intereſt, rather than obeyeſt thy Ruler.

Where neither the Nature of the thing, nor the Subjects Reaſon or Profit is convincing, nor any other by-Reſpect induceth him to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And thy <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to thoſe things is the cleareſt evidence of thy ſubjection to Higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which is undoubtedly according to the Law of Nature, and Will of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And if thou doſt not abide according to thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Conſent to ſuch Determinations of thy Rulers, and ſubmit to them, it is a plain diſcovery of ſome prejudice and diſaffection to thy Ruler, that thou thinkeſt meanly of his <hi>wiſdom,</hi> or ſuſpecteſt his <hi>goodneſs,</hi> or deſpiſeſt his <hi>Authority:</hi> That thou e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemeſt thy ſelf <hi>wiſer, better</hi> and <hi>Greater</hi> than he

                  </p>
                  <p>The Law may be poſitive, and voluntary of things in their own nature Indifferent, yet thy <hi>Submiſſion</hi> muſt be natural to juſt Determinations, and according to the Law of Nature and Rules of Chriſt, as certainly as there is any Morality in the fifth Commandement, or that <hi>Peter</hi> was an Apoſtle and wrote the Will of Chriſt, who bids us <hi>ſubmit to every</hi> humane <hi>Ordinance for the Lords ſake.</hi>

                  <p>That naturally every man hath a ſenſe of a Deity, is beyond Controverſie. He ſees and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves himſelf, and all things viſible, to be made and upheld by an Inviſible Power, and governed and diſpoſed by a more excellent wiſdom and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. From the Creation and Order of things that are made, men by natural Reaſon may come to the knowledge of a Being not made and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent: That He is a <hi>Spirit, Supream, Infinite, Omnipotent, neceſſarily Eternal, All-ſufficient,</hi> and incomprehenſibly <hi>tranſcendent</hi> in all Perfections, from the light of Reaſon (if not clouded) He muſt be <hi>acknowledged,</hi> and being thus acknowledged he muſt be <hi>worſhipped.</hi> It was not only at <hi>Athens</hi> but all the World over, That the God that Made
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102499:26"/>the World ought to be worſhipped; That this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Being may not be offended but pleaſed; and that his poor Creatures may eſcape the dreadful and intollerable effects of his Anger who is <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,</hi> and gain all the ineffable contentments of his Love who is <hi>All-ſufficient,</hi> muſt be the main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Rational men.</p>
                  <p>Now to compaſs this End, certainly <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>worſhip of GOD</hi> muſt be the way. And, what is Religion? <hi>It is a reſpectful obſervance of that Majeſty which is to be reverently adored; A due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the rational Creature to the Supream Being.</hi> This <hi>Reſpect</hi> conſiſts in three things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In high apprehenſions and eſtimation of Gods infinite Excellencies and Perfections. <hi>To think highly and honourably of God, is the beginning of Piety and Religion.</hi> Aug.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In ſuitable Affections. Having rightly eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med God as the beſt and greateſt of Beings, that we <hi>fear</hi> him as the Greateſt, and <hi>love</hi> him as the Beſt, is another part of that Reſpect we owe to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In a ſuitable ſignification of both. Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing created for Society, and naturally inclining to joyn himſelf to others, and ſeeing in the ſtate we are in, we cannot comfortably hold any Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but by a ſenſible ſignification of our Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Affections; That we give Atteſtation of theſe things muſt needs be natural and neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>And theſe Sentiments of the neceſſity and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of <hi>Religion</hi> all People have had from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. All Nations were ever perſwaded, that they ſhould be moſt Proſperous who were moſt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102499:26"/>Religious. No People ſo Barbarous, but they gave joyntly their ſignifications of <hi>obſervance,</hi> and <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>reſpect</hi> to him they accounted Supream. Hence they made ſome teſtifications and acknowledgments by <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and other Religious Rites, to appeaſe and make that Deity they adored propitious and gracious. And though all Nations and People had originally and naturally received theſe impreſſions and perſwaſions of the neceſſity and commodiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Religion,</hi> yet we never read nor heard of any Famous Governours, but they have revived and cleared theſe Old Impreſſions by new Laws and Injunctions.</p>
                  <p>And whereas this care of implanting <hi>Religion</hi> in the minds of the People for their good, is to be found in all Governours that improve their Reaſon to right Ends in the diſcharge of their Offices, yet this Care ought to be chiefly and eminently in thoſe Governours, that, beſides the light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, have from the publication of the Goſpel a moſt clear diſcovery of the infinite Excellencies and Perfections of God, and of that true Religion which ties men to God, which teaches whom, and how we ought to worſhip. For if to have God Infinite appeaſed to us, and pleaſed with us, be mans ultimate End, and this End is no otherwiſe attainable than by Religion, moſt eaſily attainable by the beſt and trueſt, and that is the Religion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to us in the Goſpel; certainly, that our Rulers ſhould command an obſervance of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is very agreeable to the end of their Conſtitution, and to their Profeſſion of being <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:102499:27"/>
                  <p>The firſt deſign of a Ruler, ſet over the People for their good, is to take care for what is beſt; and the care of <hi>Religion</hi> is the beſt Care men can have in this World. <hi>Hear, O ye Kings, underſtand and learn ye that are Judges of the Earth.</hi> Men muſt <hi>give unto</hi> Caeſar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caeſars; and <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf muſt <hi>give unto God the things that are Gods.</hi> The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Kings had the Book of the <hi>Law</hi> delivered to them, and our Kings the Book of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> at their Inauguration.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider the effects of Religion, the ſweet fruits of it in our own private condition, or more publick relation, that Bleſſedneſs which at all times and every where does accompany her, we cannot wonder, that it ſhould be our own, and the Rulers care to promote and advance Religion. There is a delight and great content that ariſes from all holy <hi>employments,</hi> and a bleſſedneſs inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from all holy <hi>affections. Light is ſown for the righteous, and joy for them that are true of heart. Poverty of ſpirit</hi> entitles to the Kingdom of Heaven, mourning to comfort, <hi>hungring and thirſting after righteouſneſs</hi> attended with ſatisfaction and fulneſs; <hi>the pure in heart</hi> are nearer to the fight of God. <hi>Piety</hi> brings the beſt contentment, and the ſureſt gain; <hi>Her waies are waies of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, and all her paths are peace.</hi> It is this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we cannot be fit for any Society: He cannot truly love his Neighbour, that does not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and love God; he cannot be faithful and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, he cannot be ſweet and kind, and eaſie to others.</p>
                  <p>And now be your own Judges, you the prophane and irreligious men of theſe Times, whoſe wit (the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102499:27"/>thing you ſo much pretend to) ſhews it ſelf in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but in ſcoffing at Religion, and in making it a trick of State to preſerve Peace and Order. Is it not juſt and reaſonable, that you ſhould ſuffer the reſults of your own Judgment, be baniſhed out of all Society, be excluded from the protection of a well-ordered Government; ſeeing you would laugh that out of the World which your ſelves confeſs unawares to be ſo conducive to the preſervation of it?</p>

                  <head>SECT. II. <hi>Governours are to endeavour amongſt their Subjects, to promote the outward exerciſe of Religion.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE outward exerciſe of Religion is natural to us, while we are converſant on Earth: For, as it is natural to worſhip and ſerve God (who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the thoughts, intentions and affections) with our <hi>Spirits;</hi> ſo it is Natural, to give ſome external and ſenſible demonſtrations of that inward Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that, while we Converſe with men, we may give them ſatisfaction and evidence of our being <hi>Religious.</hi> And, among men, the Ruler ought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all to be ſatisfied, that he may with chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and pleaſure adminiſter his office, and give up his account with joy, as having not watched for the good of his People in vain.</p>
                  <p>Now, the thoughts of the Subject are not under the Rulers cognizance; He can judge only by the outward acts. God alone knows effects by cauſes;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102499:28"/>We no otherwiſe know Cauſes than by Effects, Fire by <hi>heat,</hi> the Sun by <hi>light,</hi> and Life by <hi>motion,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by <hi>exerciſe,</hi> and Affection by <hi>outward ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.</hi> And we are to make theſe ſenſible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations, not only for the ſatisfaction of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but alſo for the glory of God; whom as we are to glorifie with all the faculties of our Souls, to know and conſider his Excellencies with our <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings,</hi> to ſubmit to, and obey him in our <hi>Wills;</hi> ſo we are to worſhip him with our <hi>Bodies,</hi> our <hi>hands</hi> to be lifted up to him, our <hi>Eyes</hi> to wait on him, our <hi>Ears</hi> to hear him, and our <hi>Tongues</hi> to praiſe him.</p>
                  <p>The neceſſity of this outward exerciſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion appears farther, from our being made not to be alone but for Society: And no Society can be maintained without an outward Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The acknowledgment of this we may by a very eaſie conſequence force from thoſe Men, that profeſs to be ſo much againſt it; who aſſemble to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and in their Aſſemblies uſe long Prayers, and prolixe Preachings, without which exerciſes and viſible attendances, they think they cannot evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence themſelves Religious, with ſatisfaction either to themſelves or others.</p>
                  <p>Were we indeed in the ſtate of <hi>Angels,</hi> and able to communicate our thoughts by inviſible ſpecies, and by our bare volitions; then (and not till then) we might upon the pretence of a true heart, and a good diſpoſition of mind content our ſelves and our Neighbours. In the mean time, it is natural in all things, to give ſome ſenſible indication of our thoughts, and to ſignifie to others, how we are
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102499:28"/>affected within: <hi>Bodies</hi> and <hi>Souls,</hi> whilſt united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, muſt needs have an influence upon one another; A diſtracted mind has a lowring brow, and a merry heart has a chearful countenance. By this outward exerciſe of Religion we raiſe an eſteem and love of Religion, in our ſelves, and in others.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In our ſelves. For we grow into a love of, and delight in that thing we daily converſe with; it becomes eaſie and familiar to us. Acts become Habits, and are rooted faſt by a frequent repetition. Strength is encreaſed by uſe, and love of Religion by exerciſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In others. For man is prone to Imitation, and haſtily follows Example. We do many things for no other reaſon, but becauſe others do them.</p>
                  <p>And here we muſt needs be amazed at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable ſpeeches of <hi>Quakers,</hi> and others, who, becauſe God is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the Goſpel requires a worſhip in <hi>ſpirit,</hi> will have God to diſregard <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals,</hi> and not to think himſelf glorified by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Services. Wild principles, mad deluſions, fitted to deſtroy all Government, and to make all Chriſtian Converſation unneceſſary. For, if God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept not <hi>external actions,</hi> when agreeable to the Law, and be not diſpleaſed with them, when diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable; if God himſelf be ſo unconcerned, we have little reaſon to take any care in our Actions. But we are to remember, that the Laws of the Goſpel are of two ſorts; ſome relating to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and affections, and actions <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>internal;</hi> theſe Laws tend to the private peace of a man, and his happineſs within himſelf. Other Laws reſpecting the outward words and actions,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102499:29"/>and deſigning to make a man happy in <hi>Society</hi> and <hi>Converſation,</hi> and to fit him to do things to the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and comfort of others, and to the honour of Chriſtianity.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>P<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>blick.</hi> Only of things done in Publick can the Governour take cognizance of; and certainly, no wiſe Magiſtrate did ever make a Law concerning thoſe things, which he could have no knowledge of afterwards, whether they were done or no. The Worſhip of God (excepting times of Perſecution, and ſuch neceſſities) was ever <hi>publick,</hi> ſince there was any at all. Hence all people had their Altars or Groves, their Mountains or Vallies, their Orbs, Tabernacles or Temples, where they all met at ſet times, and their fixed <hi>Sacrifices, Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Religious performances,</hi> wherein they all joyned at their meetings.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102499:30"/>I fully perſwade my ſelf, there is nothing contributes more to the being and continuance of our <hi>Diviſion,</hi> than a general raſhneſs and injudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; When men run away with ſome ſudden <hi>partial Notions,</hi> and <hi>ſlight Apprehenſions</hi> of things of great neceſſity, and deſerved eſteem in the World; and do not ſeriouſly and diſcurſively make a right Judgment, and agree of the full ſenſe and meaning of them as they import.</p>
                  <p>To inſtance in ſome few particulars, which is eaſie for any to obſerve.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Goſpel,</hi> moſt ſay, they highly eſteem; and yet we cannot but obſerve, that moſt ſnatch and run away with it as a <hi>promiſe of Mercy,</hi> but never regard it as a <hi>rule of Duty,</hi> and direction of an holy life.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>two Sacraments</hi> are Seals of the Covenant betwixt God and us; and moſt men are very heedful at Receiving them, that God may ſeal to them <hi>Remiſſion of ſins,</hi> and never regard that at the ſame time they covenant under Seal, to yield <hi>Obedience</hi> to God.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Blood of Chriſt</hi> is precious, and its ſhedding to be had in everlaſting remembrance; but when moſt men moſt ſolemnly remember it, this Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration contents them, <hi>That Chriſts Blood was ſhed for our Redemption, for remiſſion of ſins, to reconcile God to man, &amp;c.</hi> When we ſhould think how this <hi>Blood-ſhedding</hi> was, That men might be reconciled to God, and be redeemed from an <hi>unclean conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi> and by this ſprinkling be ſanctified and <hi>purged from dead works to ſerve the living God,</hi> Heb. 9.13, 14.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>gifts of the Spirit</hi> we juſtly value and admire; but is it not too apparent men are taken up with gifts of <hi>Edification,</hi> and paſs by gifts and true grace of <hi>Sanctification;</hi> ſo that if a man be but ready in a Scripture phraſe, hath gotten a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble Tongue, a round expreſſion, &amp;c. he gets the name and repute of a <hi>Saint</hi> immediately. But the exerciſe of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> which are the certain evidences of true Sanctity; Theſe things ſtand by neglected and deſpiſed.</p>
                  <p>I might inſtance in ſeveral things that we frame the ſame Conſideration of. If we give God but a piece of a Duty, we think a <hi>maimed</hi> and <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſacrifice</hi> will content him, and expiate and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie him, and excuſe all our defects and enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and with groſs miſtakes we ſee evidently men delude and deceive themſelves in this unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward generation.</p>
                  <p>And although in many things our <hi>miſtakes</hi> of theſe ſorts haſten our irreligious <hi>miſcarriages,</hi> yet in nothing are they more manifeſt than in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Faith.</hi> From all Chriſtians that make any profeſſion of the true Religion, we ſhall hear theſe pretences, That <hi>they live by Faith, walk by Faith, are juſtified by Faith, are ſaved by Faith, &amp;c.</hi> And yet for all this noiſe we hear of theſe things, we can ſee but few that make a true judgment, or have a right underſtanding of the full meaning of the <hi>real Faith in Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Faith of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its undeniably true, that without believing that ſupernatural Truth of <hi>Chriſts Merits</hi> for our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and remiſſion of ſins, there can be no <hi>peace</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:102499:31"/>for men, but they muſt die and conſume in the <hi>guilt</hi> of their Tranſgreſſions. It is certainly true, that Chriſt our <hi>High Prieſt</hi> put away ſins by the ſacrifice of himſelf: but when Chriſt our deſigned Mediatour was <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Prophet</hi> as well as Prieſt. It is not barely a fruitleſs relying, or a lazy recum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bency on Chriſts Merits, as our <hi>Prieſt</hi> only; but our believing his Laws and Directions he left his Church, as a <hi>King:</hi> the obſerving his Counſels and Injunctions he gave as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> is neceſſary to make up that <hi>Faith,</hi> which will bring us to the <hi>end of our Hope, which is the ſalvation of our ſouls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It's undeniably true, that in the Goſpel are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven exceeding great and precious Promiſes of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> upon which God hath cauſed <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Every <hi>Believer</hi> is to ſhine as <hi>lights in the World, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe generation,</hi> and that can only diſcern <hi>Externals.</hi> Therefore the Believers <hi>outward</hi> carriage and deportment, and converſe muſt be ſo ordered like <hi>lights,</hi> to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning and warming the blind and benummed World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Outwardly</hi> we are to manage our ſelves, as we may direct, ſtrengthen, and comfort our Neighbour, <hi>Poverty of ſpirit, hungring and thirſting after Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Purity of heart, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe are Duties of the firſt rank, and primarily to be taken care of, to preſent our ſelves ſo as to be approved by our God. <hi>Theſe ought ye to have done, and not to have left the other undone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For there be many <hi>external Duties</hi> neceſſary for Communion, amidſt the ſociety of the Faithful, that muſt not be omitted and refuſed, as <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>hearing</hi> the Word; <hi>Adminiſtring</hi> and <hi>receiving</hi>

                  <p>Thus the Church of God among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that met at the Ark and Temple in <hi>Jeruſalem, The Tribes went up, for the Teſtimony of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>to give thanks to the Name of the Lord;</hi> and theſe were <hi>External.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the Church of Chriſt, united under the faith of the Goſpel, had their <hi>Praying, preaching</hi> the new Law, <hi>ſinging</hi> of Hymns; while Chriſt continued on Earth amongſt them: And when gone up to Heaven, <hi>they continued in Aſsembling, and breaking of Bread, and Prayers.</hi> They had their Liturgies and publick Adminiſtrations, not only in works of <hi>Charity</hi> but works of <hi>Piety.</hi> They had their ſacrifices of <hi>Praiſe,</hi> the fruit of their lips, and <hi>giving thanks to the Name of the Lord.</hi> They had their <hi>propheſying at Church</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and what was to be done by the Church on Earth. They had <hi>Viſions</hi> of the Examples to lead them, from the Angels both in Earth and Heaven. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can a viſible Church or Society think to be continued without <hi>open profeſſion</hi> and <hi>declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> They that worſhipped God in their <hi>ſpirits,</hi> were ready to bow their <hi>knees</hi> to him. They that <hi>knew</hi> God, made their <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment.</hi>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:102499:34"/>They that believed in their heart, for their <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> made <hi>confeſſion</hi> with their mouths, to help on their own and others <hi>ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus by Preſidents of <hi>Saints</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> the Goſpel of Chriſt doth lead his Church as the Law of Nature directs it, not only to Religion but its <hi>exerciſe,</hi> nor the Goſpel only to Faith, but the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of Faith; that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Member united to that viſible Society of <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> muſt <hi>hold the profeſſion of his Faith without wavering.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And there's the next particular; The injunction of what both <hi>Nature</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> directs us unto, is not unlawful but neceſſary, and both require that of our Faith we ſhould make <hi>Profeſſion;</hi> and it is very good, that <hi>Rulers</hi> from their <hi>Subjects</hi> require the ſame.</p>

                  <head>SECT. III. <hi>Every particular Believing Subject ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd to this open profeſſion of Faith.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>PRofeſſion of <hi>Faith</hi> is an eſſential of the viſible Church, and none can be concluded in the Judgment of men, of the viſible Church, that doth not make profeſſion of Faith.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>viſible Church</hi> is not a Company but a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and what makes the Society a <hi>Church</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith. Every one is to evidence him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of this Society; if he will claim right to the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of a Society, he muſt perform the <hi>offices</hi> and <hi>duties,</hi> and be diligent in the Miniſtration of the Society.</p>
                  <p>A Miniſter may gather a Company, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not gather a Church, nor make them to be ſo by his own ſingle confeſſion. Every man that will approve himſelf of the Church, muſt not only give a tacit, but an expreſs conſent by an open <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</hi> This is neceſſary for conſtituting every man in <hi>Church-memberſhip,</hi> and this is rationally required and injoyn'd of Chriſtian Governours, to their Believing Subjects, for their own and Subjects ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>This concerns the whole Congregation, and is to be done not only by the <hi>Clergy</hi> but <hi>Laity,</hi> not only <hi>Prieſt</hi> but <hi>People,</hi> not only <hi>Men</hi> but <hi>Women,</hi> nor only they that are grown up, but <hi>Children. Out of the mouth of Babes and Sucklings,</hi> God thus hath
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102499:35"/>his <hi>praiſe</hi> perfected; and in his Temple, when met for Gods worſhip, <hi>every one muſt ſpeak for his Honour,</hi> of ſuch as have received the Faith of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>And this we are led unto by the eminent Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> who ſerved and pleaſed God, that Church triumphant in Heaven. Thus when we knew not where we were, before the foundations of the Earth were laid, every Angel ſignified his <hi>conſent</hi> and <hi>delight,</hi> he had in the enjoyment of God; <hi>Job</hi> 38.7. <hi>All thoſe Morning Stars ſang together, and all the Sons of God ſhouted for joy.</hi> No Dignity exempted any of thoſe from Duty; They all ſang together, they all ſhouted together for joy.</p>
                  <p>And the multitude of that heavenly Hoſt, that appeared to the <hi>Shepheards,</hi> commended this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to every particular Saint, it being obſerved and recorded for an imitation, that every one was <hi>praiſing God, and ſaying, Glory be to God on high, on earth peace, good will towards men,</hi> Luke 2.13, 14.</p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Viſion</hi> that St. <hi>John</hi> recorded, that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Divine that now is equal if not above Angels, is for direction and imitation of us, and others, to the end of the World; and what he heard, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.11, 12, 13. <hi>And I beheld and heard the voice of many Angels round about the Throne, and the Beaſts, and the Elders, and the number of them was ten thouſand times ten thouſand, and thouſand of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, crying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain, to receive power, &amp;c. and every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is in Heaven heard I ſaying, Bleſſing, Honour, Glory and Power, &amp;c.</hi> Certainly this was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to inſtruct us, that this ought to be the <hi>duty</hi> of every particular Saint on Earth, which does the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102499:35"/>work of every <hi>Saint</hi> and <hi>Angel</hi> in Heaven. That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man of Chriſts Temple below, as well as of that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, ſhould ſpeak to his Honour, ſet forth his Praiſe.</p>
                  <p>And thus they thought it, and practiced the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> and <hi>Diſciples</hi> of Chriſt in their firſt meeting, who made confeſſion of their Faith in that Article of the Reſurrection, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.33, 34. not only the <hi>Eleven,</hi> but <hi>they that were with them were ſaying, The Lord is riſen indeed, and hath appeared to Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> The Diſciples come from <hi>Emmaus,</hi> were they ſilent? <hi>They told what things were done in the way, and how he was known by breaking of Bread.</hi> And thus they continued ſpeaking till <hi>Chriſt</hi> came among them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 13.2, 3. the Church met together at <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> and there we find them met at their Liturgy; there was a <hi>publick</hi> miniſtration they all agreed in: That <hi>miniſtring</hi> was not touching the People, then it would have been <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>To inſtance in one more, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24. they were all <hi>Propheſying.</hi> In their holy Aſſemblies at <hi>Corinth</hi> the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſuppoſeth, that there was a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs they were all imployed in; it is ſet forth in the word <hi>Propheſying,</hi> what can we in reaſon under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by that word? Sure it was not <hi>Preaching,</hi> for if all were preaching, who could be hearing. It was not <hi>fore-telling things to come;</hi> this was given about that time to ſome extraordinarily, upon the plentiful effuſion of the Spirit, but not commonly or generally to every Believer. It was not exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical effuſion from <hi>gifts of Tongue,</hi> given to all to ſpeak; that was not given to all, and the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102499:36"/>if he upon his coming in had found them all thus buſied would have accounted them mad; but Laity and Clergy Women as well as men might be imployed in this <hi>Propheſying.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this work every Believer was buſie about, it muſt be therefore ſome open and plain declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either of ſome Article or Articles of <hi>Religion,</hi> or ſome acknowledgment of the <hi>divine Perfections,</hi> or ſome ſpeaking freely in <hi>praiſing</hi> of God, or <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> unto him; for they were publickly miniſtring to the Lord, they were falling down and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him, as the Apoſtle ſuppoſeth, <hi>that</hi> (being convinced by the joynt actual concurrence of every Believer) <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeliever coming in,</hi> would <hi>fall down and worſhip God with them, ſaying, of a truth God was in the midſt of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſuppoſeth it done by the Believers and Saints at <hi>Corinth,</hi> what he deſired might be done by the Saints at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> that they did not decline their Aſſembling themſelves together for <hi>Religious</hi> purpoſes, nor in their Aſſembling did any one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of his Faith, which every one was to hold faſt without wavering.</p>
                  <p>In probability there was ſome Liturgy they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in at <hi>Corinth,</hi> as there was among the Believers at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and at <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and every Believer accounted himſelf obliged to give his attendance on it, and joynt concurrence with it, to the <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>worſhip</hi> of God. Every one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a Sacrifice not <hi>private</hi> or <hi>mental,</hi> which was not diſcernable by man, but <hi>vocal,</hi> the fruit of his lips, and Unbeliever might ſenſibly perceive it; and this tended to the ſervice of God though <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,</hi>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:102499:36"/>and well they were aſſured, that <hi>with ſuch Sacrifices</hi> (which was every Chriſtians duty to offer) when they were offered, <hi>God was well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus every Believer by the practice of the Church of Chriſt, in pureſt times, is led to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith,</hi> and I appeal to any mans Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Experience to determine, if he be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, whether upon a wilful omiſſion of this Duty any true Believer can reſt ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>For if I be a ſincere Believer, I can never ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie my ſelf, unleſs, as I owe, ſo I give all unto Gods glory: The Hypocrite will to his power keep back ſomething, but the Chriſtian which is ſincerely <hi>holy</hi> will give all. He knows and conſiders that his Body is <hi>created, redeemed, ſanctified,</hi> and ſhall be <hi>glorified,</hi> to <hi>preſent them a living ſacrifice to God, is but reaſonable ſervice.</hi> That it is not a <hi>gift</hi> but a <hi>debt,</hi> he owes and is bound to pay, that as with his Soul he is to <hi>know</hi> God and <hi>love</hi> him, ſo he is to offer his Tongue to <hi>praiſe</hi> God, and his Body to <hi>worſhip</hi> him.</p>
                  <p>But if I be diligent in the <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of my Faith, I forthwith feel a content and ſatisfaction attending and accompanying my <hi>holy</hi> imployments, and a delightful <hi>pleaſantneſs</hi> ſpreads it ſelf over my Soul, while my Body is buſied in <hi>religious</hi> exerciſes. Its the moſt <hi>reliſhing</hi> meat and drink for Gods Children thus to do their Fathers will, and theſe <hi>Services</hi> are their greateſt freedom. Thoſe that are beloved of God, and after his own heart, feel their Souls <hi>ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſs,</hi> while their Mouths <hi>freely praiſe him with joyful lips.</hi>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:102499:37"/>No ſuch <hi>full content</hi> as in thoſe exerciſes of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which hath the greateſt profeſſion of <hi>delight</hi> in this life, and the moſt certain expectation of thoſe <hi>full joyes</hi> that are to come.</p>
                  <p>Thus we moſt pleaſe our ſelves, and we beſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our Neighbours, in whatſoever Relation he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects us in the practice of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> which directly tends to true Happineſs. Our <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi> the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> our <hi>Equals,</hi> are all ſolicitous to know and be aſſured of our <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and when they can perceive they have not watched over us nor laboured in vain, they are moſt delighted and beſt pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>Now our Relations are not to be ſatisfied in the ſtate we are in, with probable conjectures of our meanings and intentions, but they muſt have clear and ſignificant expreſſion of our minds and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, either by <hi>words</hi> or <hi>actions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſullen <hi>ſilence</hi> cannot content us in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, but we muſt have ſenſible aſſurance of our mutual <hi>aſſent</hi> or <hi>refuſal.</hi> In our Secular Trafficks and Commerces, we cannot carry on our Bargains but by external ſignification: And as in <hi>Temporal</hi> ſo in <hi>Spiritual</hi> Covenants, there is a neceſſity of theſe things when no communion can be held with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. We cannot be mutually pleaſed with mutual aſſurances of our purpoſes, to ſtand firm to the Faith of the Goſpel, without an open <hi>declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> unleſs every one <hi>hold</hi> forth <hi>the profeſſion of his Faith without wavering.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There can be no contenting aſſurance of any perſons continuing a Member of a viſible Church, without <hi>profeſſion of Faith</hi> in Service or Sacrament;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:102499:37"/>Hearing the Word preach'd only is no ſufficient evidence; I am in charity to believe the <hi>Miniſter</hi> to be a good man, becauſe he ſignifies his pious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions by Religious expreſſions: But I cannot in reaſon conclude the Hearer ſo long as he ſaies nothing. If People wanted nothing but <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Converſion,</hi> or <hi>Faith,</hi> if <hi>ignorant</hi> or <hi>uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,</hi> I could excuſe this <hi>boulimy</hi> among us, and it were far more tolerable that people mind only Sermons: But when People are <hi>knowing</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, baptized</hi> and <hi>ingaged</hi> in Profeſſion, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it were more truly Religious to ſpend ſome time in <hi>doing</hi> as well as <hi>hearing,</hi> to ſhew they have not heard in vain, but that they have got this <hi>Faith</hi> they ſo greedily heard for, by holding forth the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> of it &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>By Hearing conſtantly, I in charity conclude thou deſireſt to be good, thou wouldſt get <hi>Faith;</hi> but if <hi>Hearing</hi> is all, how can I without raſhneſs judge that thou art <hi>good,</hi> or haſt got <hi>Faith,</hi> which is not evident to me without thy <hi>Profeſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a painted, no real Fire, that hath neither <hi>light</hi> nor <hi>heat:</hi> It is a Stock, a Log, not a living Tree, that hath neither <hi>leaves</hi> nor <hi>fruit:</hi> It is a Carkaſs, not a living Body, that hath neither <hi>words</hi> nor <hi>motion:</hi> It is Preſumption, and no living Faith, that is not ſignified by <hi>Profeſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now with all meekneſs, I beſeech thoſe that ſeparate from us, ſeriouſly to conſider this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Truth, That the viſible certain ſign of any Companies or Perſons, being indeed of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church that is Militant, is the Peoples <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith</hi> in Service and Sacraments.</p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:102499:38"/>
                  <p>Since therefore <hi>Profeſſion of Faith</hi> is of ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and hath ſo great an influence to pleaſe both our ſelves and others, and is a duty and ſervice, by Goſpel Rules, incumbent to every Chriſtian, we may truly conclude, That the Chriſtian Magiſtrate may and ought to injoyn <hi>an open Profeſſion of Faith</hi> to each believing Subject in his reſpective Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>

                  <p>Such Congregations of <hi>Believers</hi> as reſpect the Worſhip and Service of God, are the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we mean, and the Believer is to diſcharge his duty of <hi>Profeſſion</hi> in the midſt of them.</p>

                  <p>Confeſſion of Faith is not expected, when not called to it, to be made to <hi>Perſecutors,</hi> or <hi>Infidels,</hi> that are profeſſed enemies of the Goſpel: where there is more probability of their <hi>Rage,</hi> than <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi> and where there is no hope of advancing Gods <hi>glory,</hi> or our Neighbours <hi>good;</hi> where there is leſs hope of dying a <hi>Martyr,</hi> than danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Manſlayer, where he may ſeem to conſpire with the <hi>Perſecutors</hi> to take away his own life.</p>

                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.6. By Chriſts own direction, we are not to caſt <hi>holy things to dogs,</hi> nor <hi>pearls to ſwine, leaſt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102499:39"/>they trample them under foot, and turn again and rent you.</hi> But holy things are properly tendred to holy Men. Our delight to communicate theſe ſhould be chiefly to the <hi>Saints</hi> of the Earth, and ſuch as pretend at leaſt a deſire to excel in vertue; yea, where we may act with <hi>ſafety</hi> to our ſelves, and probably with <hi>benefit</hi> to others, there <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> is beſt made, and that if among a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Believers.</p>
                  <p>And for any that ſtupidly or ſottiſhly ſit at home, ſoaking and ſmoaking in their Chimney Corners ſecurely, indulging the <hi>ſenſual</hi> part, and never regard but ſlight the opportunities of Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings conveniently, and communicating of holy <hi>apprehenſions</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> for their own and Neighbours comfort. We muſt look upon them as an <hi>unnatural</hi> ſort of Men, and the moſt lazy kind of the beaſts of the people, who induſtriouſly ſtudy to be uſeleſs, and to neglect their own and the general good of the Neighbourhood, which they are obliged to further and maintain. And, if they have ſharp <hi>goads</hi> and <hi>laſhes,</hi> to prick them or quicken them vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly to move under that yoke to which they are naturally bound, it is no more than what is juſt and reaſonable, for the good and welfare of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, which every particular <hi>Officer</hi> and <hi>Ruler</hi> are concerned to promote and advance.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> of Meeting, that theſe be determined by the wiſdom of the Governours, upon Convenience, as beſt conducing for the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good</hi> of the Society, are things ſo unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable, as I think will meet with no oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:102499:39"/>
                  <p>Now, that every Chriſtian is bound to attend theſe Congregations, to advance <hi>Religion,</hi> and propagate the <hi>general good;</hi> he hath loſt his Reaſon as well as Religion that dares deny it.</p>
                  <p>For what things we find experimentally, either to be believed or done, to be good and comfortable to ones ſelf, we ought to impart and communicate to the good of others; and what St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſired to ſee his Brethren, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. ſo we ſhould put in practice, as near as we can, to impart ſome <hi>Spiritual gifts,</hi> that we may be comforted together with them, by the mutual <hi>faith</hi> both of them and our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Temporal</hi> things, ſuch is our unhappy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and the baſeneſs of the things, as if we would have any good to our ſelves, we muſt have a particular propriety in them and injoyment of them. The more we give others, the leſs we injoy to our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>But for <hi>Spiritual</hi> things, the commoner the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; as there ought not, ſo there needs not of them be deſired an appropriation; our <hi>propriety</hi> is not loſt by <hi>Communication.</hi> Theſe things like ſeeds, they multiply by <hi>ſcattering,</hi> as fire kindles by <hi>blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> ſo our <hi>Faith</hi> increaſes by <hi>Confeſſion. Draw me and we will run after thee.</hi> Holy Souls, when drawn to good things, would have others <hi>good</hi> with them; not ſo ſelfiſh to run alone, but call others to bear them company. <hi>Andrew</hi> calls <hi>Peter, Philip Nathaniel,</hi> to come to Chriſt. <hi>David</hi> would have the <hi>Tribes</hi> go up to the <hi>Houſe of the Lord,</hi> to bear teſtimony with him, and give thanks with him, &amp;c.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102499:40"/>And when with him, there he would have others <hi>ſing</hi> with him, <hi>rejoyce</hi> with him, <hi>fall down</hi> with him, <hi>worſhip</hi> with him.</p>
                  <p>So the Author to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> not <hi>forſake meeting,</hi> nor in their meeting <hi>mutual Exhortation, offering Sacrifice, Thanksgiving, Profeſſion of Faith,</hi> none excepted or excluded. Every one, without injury to himſelf, may help on his Neighbour, by <hi>exerciſe of Religion,</hi> and <hi>profeſſion of Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And certainly, the declaring and publiſhing of our firm aſſent, and ſoundneſs of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> muſt help on the <hi>reſolution,</hi> and ſettle the <hi>conſtancy</hi> of others in the ſame things. Thus are we props and ſtaies to our ſtaggering and ſinking Brethren; and others waxing ſtrong in the Lord, and being ſtrengthned and confirmed in their Faith, grow confident in their Profeſſion alſo. And <hi>when thou art</hi> thyſelf <hi>converted,</hi> thou oughteſt alſo to <hi>ſtrengthen thy Brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we blow up the coals of <hi>Devotion,</hi> and kindle that <hi>Piety</hi> that breaks out into an <hi>heavenly flame,</hi> to the inlightning and warming both our ſelves and our Neighbours. Thus we <hi>ſhine as lights in the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While all agree, and every one is intent in the Congregation on this <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> we ſtand directly under the influx of Grace. It is the probable way, when we are all thus imployed, to have Chriſt come and make one of the Company. While in <hi>Via,</hi> like the two Diſciples going to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> while we are thus communing, <hi>Jeſus</hi> may draw near and go with us. While we are thus ſpeaking, no doubt but Chriſt is ready to ſtand in the midſt of us,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102499:40"/>and ſay, <hi>peace be unto us;</hi> for ſo he hath promiſed, and he is faithful, <hi>That when two or three are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in his Name, he will be in the midſt of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With this general <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Miniſtring</hi> uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally goes along the <hi>miniſtration</hi> of the Spirit. And, whoſoever would not quench or ſtint the <hi>Spirit</hi> in this operation to <hi>Holineſs,</hi> he ought not to neglect or deſpiſe this kind of Propheſying.</p>
                  <p>It is a probable way, in the Apoſtles Judgment, to work upon thoſe that are <hi>without the Church,</hi> and <hi>unconverted,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24, 25. when every one, and all in a believing Congregation are thus <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying,</hi> ſpeaking freely, and preaching and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Gods <hi>Excellencies</hi> and <hi>Perfections,</hi> and ſhew our ſelves reverencing him and believing in him; when an <hi>Heathen</hi> or <hi>Infidel</hi> come into ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, <hi>He will fall down and worſhip God alſo,</hi> being convinced of the <hi>reaſonableneſs, neceſſity</hi> and <hi>benefit</hi> of the duty, by our reſpective Harmony and Uniformity, he will ſay, <hi>of a truth, verily God is in the midſt of us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He is worſe than <hi>Saul,</hi> that will not thus <hi>propheſie among the Prophets,</hi> and ſeeing others unanimouſly and devoutly <hi>worſhipping</hi> and <hi>confeſſing</hi> to God, who will not fall down and worſhip God alſo.</p>
                  <p>And while thus like <hi>Elijah,</hi> we are riding up to Heaven in the Chariots of this <hi>holy fire,</hi> it is not improbable that others like <hi>Eliſha,</hi> ſtanding by, may have the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> reſting upon them.</p>
                  <p>Thus every one that aims at the general <hi>good</hi> of himſelf and others, be they within the Church, or be they without the Church, is obliged to an <hi>open
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102499:41"/>profeſſion of Faith,</hi> in that reſpective Congregation to which he is aſſociated, that he may be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to draw others to the worſhip of our glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God, who before perhaps little regarded him.</p>
                  <p>And that <hi>Governours,</hi> that are to aim at the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good of the Society, ſhould injoyn every <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Subject</hi> to a duty ſo extenſively beneficial, is ſo clear that it needs no further demonſtration.</p>
                  <p>In Fine, Our <hi>Governours,</hi> as <hi>Chriſts</hi> Deputies, who are to Rule by Chriſts new Law, the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> have done well to injoyn to their Believing <hi>Subjects</hi> an open <hi>profeſſion of Faith</hi> in their reſpective Congregations. And, that this Profeſſion ought to be ſignified by an open <hi>

                  <p>THE Nature of the <hi>Church</hi> of God is beſt repreſented and deciphered unto us under the reſemblance of a Body; As many <hi>Members</hi> make one Body, ſo many <hi>Believers</hi> make one Church. By ſeveral <hi>Nerves</hi> and <hi>Sinews</hi> the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102499:42"/>ſeveral Members are compacted into one Body. By ſeveral Laws of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as ſo many <hi>Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> the ſeveral Believers are fitly joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into one Church; and as many Members compacted by the ſame <hi>Nerves</hi> are enlivened and guided by <hi>one</hi> Soul, ſo many Believers joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the ſame <hi>Laws</hi> are quickned and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by <hi>one</hi> Spirit. <hi>For the Body is not one member but many: For by one Spirit, we are all baptized <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> one Body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</hi> Thus we believe <hi>one Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and <hi>one Catholick Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> many other Figures and Repreſentations we meet of the <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt, which all ſpeak the neceſſity of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of ſeveral parts for its Conſtitution. Sometimes we find it compared to <hi>Noahs Ark,</hi> as <hi>Extra Arcam</hi> ſo <hi>Extra Eccleſiam nulla ſalus:</hi> In thoſe great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations of <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>miſery,</hi> wherewith the Earth is overſpread, as once out of the <hi>Ark,</hi> ſo now out of the <hi>Church</hi> there can ordinarily be expected no Salvation. The <hi>Ark</hi> was cemented within and without with <hi>Pitch,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> with <hi>Charity.</hi> Sometimes they have likened her to a <hi>Coat,</hi> to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi> Coat that was <hi>polymita,</hi> divers coloured; to <hi>Chriſts</hi> Coat, <hi>inconſutilis,</hi> without ſeam, rents or divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                  <p>In Holy Scripture, in ſeveral places, the Church of Chriſt is compared to an <hi>Houſe</hi> or <hi>Temple.</hi> Many diſtinct <hi>ſtones,</hi> and ſeveral pieces of <hi>wood,</hi> make up <hi>one</hi> Building, for the protection, entertainment and comfort of the Owner; ſo many <hi>Believers</hi> make
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102499:42"/>up <hi>one</hi> living Temple, <hi>one</hi> ſpiritual Houſe, for Chriſt and his Spirit to dwell and delight in.</p>
                  <p>As no number of <hi>Planks</hi> can make up a Ship an Ark, without cloſe joynting: No multitude of <hi>Threds</hi> can make a warm Garment, without cloſe weaving: No <hi>Stones</hi> can make up an Houſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cloſe cementing: No <hi>Members</hi> or <hi>Parts</hi> can make up a Body, without cloſe compacting; ſo no number of <hi>Men</hi> can make up a Church without <hi>Conjunction</hi> or <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And this the Holy Spirit of Chriſt intimates unto us in that heavenly Song, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.9. <hi>My love, my undefiled is but</hi> one, <hi>the only one of her Mother, the choice one of her that bare her;</hi> yea, ſo we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and ſo we teach, there is but <hi>one Catholick Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let the <hi>Sectaries</hi> and <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> that think to drown the cry of their ſin with the noiſe of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;</hi> Let them boaſt vainely of their Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes; that every one of their Congregations, though of different Perſwaſions, is <hi>the pure Church;</hi> while they ſtudy to be many, and make Diviſions, they are not the true <hi>Spouſe</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The Devil may have many <hi>Synagagues,</hi> but Chriſt hath but <hi>one Church, one</hi> Wife, <hi>one</hi> Spouſe, <hi>one</hi> Royal Prieſthood, <hi>one</hi> holy People, <hi>one</hi> People of his purchaſe. There is but <hi>one Catholick Church, One</hi> invariable from the beginning of the World, as to <hi>Subſtantials,</hi> and ſo will continue to the end of the ſame; and rather than there ſhould be an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of <hi>two, Chriſt,</hi> our Peace, <hi>ſhed his Blood to make thoſe that ſeemed twain both one, and hath
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102499:43"/>broken down the middle wall of partition between us,</hi> Eph. 2.14. <hi>One</hi> End, to be attained by the ſame Means. <hi>One</hi> People, to be governed by the ſame Laws. <hi>One</hi> Body, to be actuated by the ſame Spirit: Of that <hi>one</hi> Body, <hi>one</hi> Head, <hi>one</hi> Faith, <hi>one</hi> Baptiſm. <hi>One Eve,</hi> the Mother of all living Men: <hi>One Church,</hi> the Mother of all Believers.</p>
                  <p>No wonder St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould ſo pathetically be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that if they would walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Vocation whereunto they were called, that they ſhould <hi>hold the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No wonder our Bleſſed Saviour, in his laſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony in the <hi>Garden,</hi> ſhould pray ſo earneſtly for thoſe eſpecially that had received the Laws which he had given them from the Father, <hi>that they might be</hi> One <hi>as they were,</hi> John 17.23. That all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him through his word, might be made perfect in one.</p>
                  <p>If we ſee rightly, we may behold Chriſt's <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Jeruſalem,</hi> that is incompaſſed with holy <hi>Angels</hi> as Walls, like a City that is compacted with the ſame Rules, as ſo many <hi>ligaments,</hi> and actuated with the ſame Spirit; accounts it not only good and joyful, but neceſſary for all the Members of the Society, to be joyned together in <hi>

                  <p>THus the Church of Chriſt began in the laſt Diſpenſation, and ſo it is to be continued in <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity: They were all,</hi> that were believers, <hi>with one accord in one place: The multitude of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved were of one heart, and one ſoul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As taught of God, ſo of Chriſt they were taught <hi>to love one another,</hi> and <hi>to do unto others as they would be done by;</hi> like members of the ſame Body, mutually ſympathizing, <hi>weeping with thoſe that wept,</hi> and <hi>rejoycing with thoſe that did rejoyce; bearing one anothers burthens,</hi> and thus fulfilling the mind of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Neither had they of the Church of Chriſt a like reſpect to each others <hi>perſons,</hi> but the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the <hi>Objects</hi> that were preſented before them. They did unanimouſly agree to <hi>chuſe</hi> and <hi>refuſe,</hi> to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>hate</hi> the ſame thing. They had a like <hi>hope,</hi> a like <hi>fear,</hi> the ſame <hi>joy,</hi> the ſame <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row:</hi> Like Travellers, tending to the ſame End, they agree to walk in the ſame way, and had the ſame <hi>will,</hi> the ſame <hi>mind,</hi> the ſame <hi>affections.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As they of the Church of Chriſt are to agree in the deſires and affections of the <hi>appetitive</hi> part, ſo ought they to agree in the concluſions and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the <hi>intellective</hi> part, that nobler part of the Rational Soul of man, if they will be knit into
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102499:44"/>that Society that will hold profeſſed ſubjection to the Rules of the Goſpel. The Society of <hi>Believers</hi> are to agree in the ſame <hi>Faith,</hi> the ſame <hi>Judgment,</hi> the ſame <hi>Conſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſires and expects of the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that they ſhould be perfectly joyned together, in the ſame <hi>mind,</hi> and in the ſame <hi>judgment;</hi> and of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that they ſhould <hi>endeavour to keep the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the ſpirit in the bond of Peace,</hi> Eph. 4.3. There being meant by <hi>Spirit</hi> as elſewhere, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.23. the ſuperiour faculty of the Rational Soul, the concluſions of which were to be kept one and the ſame: For but <hi>one Body</hi> and <hi>one Spirit, even as ye are called into one hope of your calling. One Lord, One Faith, One Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. For Chriſt being aſcended, and ſet at the Right hand of God in heavenly places, and having all things put under his feet,</hi> as Head of the Church, in it appointed ſeveral Orders, and to them gave ſeveral Gifts, for the <hi>perfecting</hi> of the Saints, for the <hi>work</hi> of the Miniſtery, for the <hi>edifying</hi> his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>till every part might come in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a perfect man, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon this Rock Chriſt hath promiſed to build his Church, meaning St. <hi>Peters Faith,</hi> not his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> or <hi>Office.</hi> As Chriſt hath but <hi>one</hi> Church, ſo that one Church is founded upon <hi>one</hi> Rock, and that unmovable, unchangable, alwaies the ſame. The Rain may deſcend, the floods may come down, and the winds may blow, and waves of oppoſition may ſplit themſelves with their own violence; but the <hi>Faith</hi> of Chriſts Servants ſtand unmovable,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102499:44"/>rather confirmed than hurt: The Church of Chriſt is but <hi>One,</hi> built upon <hi>one</hi> Rock.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Synagogues</hi> of Satan are built upon heaps of <hi>Sand:</hi> Such is their Faith (if I may ſay they have any) as is like <hi>heaps of Sand,</hi> whoſe forms are changed upon every preſſure, toſſed up and down with every wind, ready to receive either augmentation or diminution upon external Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies. They are alwaies <hi>Changable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But thoſe that are truly Members of the Church of Chriſt, from an unalterable Rule, are of an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable</hi> Judgment: They are not like Children, toſſed up and down with every breath, nor carried about with diverſe and ſtrange Doctrines; but the God of hope, as he hath filled them with all joy, ſo with all <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>unity</hi> in believing. That they continue ſtedfaſt in the ſame <hi>Faith,</hi> are perfectly joyned together in the ſame <hi>Judgment;</hi> and amidſt Society of Believers, there is but <hi>one Spirit, one Conſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Head and perfection of a Rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> muſt be in <hi>Judgment.</hi> Beaſts may agree in <hi>Affection,</hi> only Men can agree in <hi>Judgment.</hi> And <hi>Judgment, Faith</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> (of which there is a noiſe in the World) are but little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; All the reſult of the Souls Reaſoning, the deliberate concluſion and agreement of her Counſel from a certain Rule and infallible. A reſpect of the <hi>Rational Creature</hi> to the Rules of the Goſpel, not only as true and warrantable, but as good and acceptable; and a ſerious purpoſe and reſolution to conform to thoſe Rules accordingly. Of which Rules ſome are <hi>ſupernatural</hi> and <hi>revealed,</hi> others
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102499:45"/>are <hi>natural;</hi> ſome <hi>poſitive,</hi> but being injoyned by Chriſt they are <hi>eternal, univerſal, indiſpenſable</hi> and <hi>binding</hi> to the Catholick Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But ſome Rules are <hi>particular,</hi> given by Chriſtian Rulers to their particular <hi>National Churches,</hi> to whoſe wiſdom Chriſt hath left the ordering and injoyning of ſome <hi>Canons,</hi> not unlawful, for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Peace. And be the <hi>Canons</hi> either concerning <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Actions,</hi> ſince they are accomodately fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the cuſtome and apprehenſions of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and are ſignificant expreſſions of the Subjects unity of <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Faith:</hi> They are <hi>binding</hi> to believing Subjects <hi>for the Lords ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that as in the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> for the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rules,</hi> ſo in <hi>particular Churches</hi> for particular Commands, where lawfully fixed and unrepealed, the Believing Subjects are to be of the ſame <hi>Faith,</hi> of the ſame <hi>Judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And where difference of <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Judgments</hi> are in the ſame conſtituted Church, impoſſible it is there ſhould be <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Affection,</hi> impoſſible it is the Souldiers and Servants ſhould be in <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> where Captains and Leaders are at <hi>variance</hi> and <hi>diſſenſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Liberty,</hi> or pretence of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> in a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Church, can never be plea ſufficient to juſtifie two differing <hi>Believers</hi> in differing and contrary undertakings. If one of thoſe undertakings be warrantable, the others muſt be unlawful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable. There is but <hi>one Conſcience, one Faith</hi> in this caſe, can be juſtifiable, as certain as there is but <hi>one Rule,</hi> and but <hi>one Truth.</hi> And when two differing Believers, in differing and contrary Actions,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102499:45"/>can have but <hi>one</hi> true and juſtifiable Rule. There cannot be in contrary Actions any more than one right <hi>Faith,</hi> or juſtifiable <hi>Conſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Conſcience is <hi>Concludens ſcientia,</hi> a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate Concluſion, and ſetled Judgment, a fixed Determination of the Intellective part from a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>infallible Rule,</hi> from which we infer, aſſume and apply to our ſelves the morality of our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and determine of the ſubſequent iſſue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. So that two things are required to make up a <hi>Conſcience:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>A deliberate Determination or Concluſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>A certain Rule from whence we infer the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of our Actions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. There muſt be a deliberate Determination in what may be called <hi>Conſcience;</hi> ſo no Example or practice of the moſt retired, mortified man, can be a <hi>Rule</hi> for thy Conſcience. The moſt devout of men are no Lords of our <hi>Faith,</hi> who at the beſt are but Helpers of our joy. <hi>Infallibility</hi> is not to be granted to any particular man, which is not granted to any particular Church of Chriſt. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can <hi>Conſcience</hi> be made up ſoundly, from the practice of a <hi>fallible man,</hi> but from the law of Nature and Rules of an <hi>Infallible God.</hi> So that it is not to be called <hi>Conſcience</hi> that is grounded on the Examples of godly Religious men, without thy own Deliberation.</p>
                  <p>Nor is that <hi>Conſcience</hi> that hath only former <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions</hi> for its Rule: for wilful <hi>obſtinacy, tima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs</hi> of purpoſe, cannot be a part of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which is not in the Appetitive part at all. Nor can <hi>Humor, Animoſity,</hi> a ſudden precipitate ingaging
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102499:46"/>be juſtified by plea of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> when there muſt be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Conſcience cannot be without <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration;</hi> neither can Deliberation, without apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or determination, be called <hi>Conſcience.</hi> For while the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> is fluctuating, queſtioning, and inquiring, it may be in tendency to it, it is not yet to be called <hi>Conſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here again, they ſeem as far from Reaſon in their expreſſions, as from Obedience in their actions, that call out for liberty of Conſcience, <hi>May not my Conſcience be free?</hi> And they would make the doubting Reaſon againſt the undoubtedly law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Command of the Superiour, in things <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> to be the weak, tender Conſcience: But where <hi>liberty</hi> or <hi>doubting</hi> is, there can be no <hi>determination</hi> of the thing doubted, and where no determination there can be no <hi>Conſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That cannot be called <hi>Conſcience</hi> that grounds not its Determination upon a certain <hi>Rule.</hi> When <hi>Conſcience</hi> is but a Witneſs to a Rule, at the beſt a <hi>ſubordinate Rule;</hi> neither can it be an <hi>abſolute Law</hi> which muſt be determined by a Law; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it may be <hi>Humor, Animoſity, Fancy</hi> or <hi>Opinion,</hi> whatever it is, ſurely it cannot rightly be called <hi>Conſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſince <hi>Conſcience</hi> cannot be without a Rule, and when the Rules of <hi>Nature</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> do not interfere, and are not contrary, there cannot be two different or contrary <hi>Conſciences</hi> that can be both good, of any profeſſed Believers in a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Church whereſoever.</p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:102499:46"/>
                  <p>Over the General <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt there be Rules <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> whoſe <hi>morality</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and ſome Rules <hi>Poſitive</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> that are eternally and univerſally binding to all <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers</hi> to the end of the World.</p>
                  <p>In all theſe Goſpel Rules, there can be but <hi>one Conſcience</hi> in all Believers undoubtedly.</p>
                  <p>And in every particular <hi>Church,</hi> ſomethings are to be determined for <hi>Peace ſake</hi> by the wiſdom of Governours, as <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place, words</hi> and <hi>geſtures, &amp;c.</hi> in the ſervice and worſhip of God.</p>
                  <p>Now in a <hi>Conſtituted Church</hi> where theſe things are determined, I deliberately declare in this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects <hi>ſubmiſſion,</hi> and the others <hi>refuſal,</hi> there can be but <hi>one Conſcience.</hi> For when indifferent things are determined by wiſe and good Rulers, moſt condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to <hi>convenience</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> the Rule, upon ſuch <hi>determination,</hi> is for every Believing Subject, to <hi>ſubmit to every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now when no <hi>Conſcience</hi> can be without a Rule, ſince I have a Rule for my <hi>Submiſſion,</hi> and thou canſt ſhew no Rule thou haſt for thy <hi>Refuſal,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it muſt be concluded, I have a Conſcience in my <hi>willing ſubjection,</hi> but thou canſt have no Conſcience in thy <hi>wilful omiſſion</hi> and <hi>oppoſition.</hi> And being there is but <hi>one Rule</hi> that is good and warrantable in all <hi>poſitive</hi> things, there can be, to ſpeak properly, in ſuch things, but <hi>one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>Reſolutions,</hi> if without, yea much more if againſt a Rule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot be called <hi>Conſcience.</hi> And
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102499:47"/>
                     <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, muſt have a double look, the firſt look it muſt caſt on the <hi>Rule,</hi> the ſecond it muſt caſt on the <hi>Actions,</hi> be they either neceſſary or poſitive, or elſe it cannot be counted <hi>Conſcience;</hi> and from thy agreeing or diſagreeing with the <hi>Rule,</hi> ſo thy <hi>Conſcience</hi> accuſeth or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth accordingly.</p>
                  <p>And now I appeal to any ſober mans Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſince there cannot be contrary <hi>Rules</hi> juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable, whether there can be contrary <hi>Conſciences.</hi> Certainly then, we may ſafely conclude in all <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Churches,</hi> ſince for Belivers actions there is but <hi>one Truth,</hi> but <hi>one true Rule;</hi> there muſt be for all ſuch Believers but <hi>one right Faith,</hi> there can be but <hi>one ſound Conſcience.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>GOD, who created man for his glory, deſigned him for Society, that what comfort he could not get by <hi>ſeparation,</hi> he might compaſs by <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi> And Communion, in the ſtate we are in, cannot be maintained but by <hi>Externals,</hi> by Bodily offices.

                  <p>So if any one ſhould ask, <hi>What is the ſign or mark by which we may know a viſible Church by, or any aſſociated Company to be a part of it.</hi> I muſt properly Anſwer, <hi>by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Lawful,</hi> as declared by the practice of all Nations that had a ſenſe of Religion.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> amidſt their Aſſemblies in all Religious obſervances.</p>
                  <p>If they were a People to whom God had more clearly manifeſted himſelf, and the true <hi>Religion,</hi> wherewith he would be well pleaſed, theſe marks they gave of their aſſociating and uniting into a Church, by their <hi>

St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> taught his Diſciples to <hi>pray.</hi> And <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Diſciples in the laſt diſpenſation, would be taught of him to <hi>pray, as John</hi> before had <hi>taught his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi> And our bleſſed Saviour not only taught his Diſciples a <hi>Form</hi> but a <hi>Prayer,</hi> which they were to ſay. <hi>When you pray, ſay,</hi> Luke 11.2. <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>To follow him can be no miſtake. Certainly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate Compoſures of <hi>Set Forms,</hi> from Chriſts Example, receive not only Toleration, but ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Approbation.</p>
                  <p>And that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and their Succeſſors, in Primitive times, uſed this Prayer in all their holy Adminiſtrations, eſpecially at the Sacraments we have more than probable Authority.</p>
                  <p>And that the Church had <hi>ſet Forms</hi> after the firſt Century, is beyond all diſpute. And that Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches have their <hi>ſet Forms</hi> now, generally, is openly manifeſt, except ſome <hi>Phanatical Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,</hi> that out of a Spirit of <hi>Contradiction,</hi> and <hi>preciſe ſingularity,</hi> by the neglect of theſe things wilfully Unchurch themſelves, and would blot out all appearance of a <hi>Viſible Church</hi> upon the Earth.</p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:102499:49"/>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> from the conviction of this Truth, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 87. approves it, <hi>That ſet Forms of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Rights might be determined; that it might not be lawful for Miniſters in their</hi> Adminiſtrations, <hi>or the People in their</hi> Attendances <hi>to vary from them.</hi> And this he was forced to acknowledge from <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Practice</hi> and <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God, who cannot erre, preſcribes <hi>ſet Forms</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and Chriſt to his Diſciples. And it would be a miſapprehenſion, yea a ſin to think, that They would injoyn or command what might be an hinderance to <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> or a diſadvantage to the Exerciſe thereof.</p>
                  <p>And the concurrent Judgment and practice of all Churches, muſt convince any ſober perſon of the lawfulneſs and expediency of <hi>ſet Forms,</hi> both in Prayers and Worſhip, which will be furthered by his own Reaſon, if he pleaſe to conſider <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> directions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſhall prove <hi>ſet Forms</hi> lawful and expedient from Scripture.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11. pathetically beſeecheth the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> by the name of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that <hi>they would all ſpeak the very ſame thing. Verba ſunt ſymbola mentis; è conſenſu verbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum colligimus conſenſum animorum.</hi> Words are but expreſſions of our Intentions, and from agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Words we conclude of agreement of Mind. And ſure enough it was not required there by the Apoſtle, that the Speeches of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in their Religious Aſſemblies, ſhould be of the <hi>ſame ſenſe</hi> and <hi>meaning</hi> only, but of the ſame <hi>expreſſion;</hi> not only <hi>contradiction</hi> of words is prohibited,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102499:49"/>but <hi>diverſity,</hi> if they would grant his ſuit, whle he beſeecheth them to ſpeak the <hi>ſame thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And well might this be injoyned in Religious Exerciſes; for, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi novae phraſes, ibi nova dogmata: A quibus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>na fides, ab iis requiritur <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>na Confeſſio.</hi> Where new <hi>phraſes</hi> are uſed, there will be new <hi>opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> And in whom there is expected but One Faith, from them there is required but One Confeſſion, ſaith Mr. <hi>Calvin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, when idolizing of the <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Parts</hi> of the Miniſters, cauſed <hi>Contentions</hi> among the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> the Apoſtle might adjudge it neceſſary, that oſtentation of <hi>Eloquence</hi> and <hi>excellency of Speech</hi> ſhould be forborn among them, even in exerciſes of Devotion, and therefore earneſtly beſeecheth them <hi>to ſpeak the ſame thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So, by St. <hi>Pauls</hi> direction, <hi>Timothy</hi> was to hold faſt <hi>the form of ſound words,</hi> at his Church at <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus;</hi> that as there is but <hi>one Faith,</hi> ſo in Believing Congregations there might be but <hi>one Confeſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this not only evinced from <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> as expedient, but from the Apoſtles pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, who having received the <hi>promiſe</hi> of the Father, and <hi>power</hi> from on high at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they agreed on <hi>one ſummary Rule</hi> for their own Teaching, and the Peoples believing, a compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſum of <hi>Evangelical Doctrines,</hi> exquiſitely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, which is delivered to us by Tradition, from Antiquity, and generally received under the Name of the <hi>Apoſtles Creed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> the intelligent Believer not only makes an acknowledgment of his <hi>aſsent</hi> to <hi>Promiſes of Mercy</hi> to be rely'd upon, but to the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102499:50"/>reaſonableneſs of <hi>Duties of Obedience</hi> that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by the Goſpel to be practiced, and makes open profeſſion of <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> which muſt be maintained by the practice of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and comprehend all the duties of Chriſtianity that are required.</p>
                  <p>And this compendious Confeſſion of Faith by repeating this <hi>ſet Form,</hi> preſcribed by the Apoſtles, hath been uſed by the <hi>People</hi> as well as the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> by which they openly declared their unfeigned <hi>Aſſent</hi> to what they did believe, and their ſtedfaſt <hi>Reſolution</hi> of what they would do, in every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation that would be reputed of the Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And if it be lawful and expedient to have <hi>ſet Forms</hi> for Confeſſion of Faith, it cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful and unfitting to have <hi>ſet Forms</hi> for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Devotion. It cannot be a <hi>reproach</hi> but a <hi>duty</hi> to have our Spirits thus ſtinted, when the <hi>Spirit of Grace</hi> limits himſelf in the Rules of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> and hath the denomination of <hi>Holy</hi> from this limitation.</p>
                  <p>And if new ſorts of Words, and variety of Expreſſions muſt be uſed in <hi>praying,</hi> as ſome wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fancy, I wonder St. <hi>Paul</hi> in all his Epiſtles, in the beginning ſhould uſe the ſame Salutation, and in the end ſhould uſe the ſame Valediction; and that Chriſt in his <hi>Agony,</hi> who wanted neither <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> or <hi>fervency,</hi> ſhould pray thrice together the ſame words.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Antioch,</hi> that the Chriſtians there in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, had their <hi>Liturgy.</hi> At <hi>Corinth,</hi> that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were all <hi>Propheſying.</hi> At <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that in their
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102499:50"/>Religious Aſſemblies, they were to <hi>hold faſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their Faith without wavering;</hi> is ſo evident, as doubtleſs it can need no further illuſtration.</p>
                  <p>And if <hi>ſet Form</hi> of Words were unlawful in Gods ſervice, certainly the multitude of <hi>Angels</hi> would never have been repreſented unto us as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing in one <hi>Anthem</hi> on Earth, nor they above in the ſame <hi>doxology</hi> in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>And if the Examples of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> may lead us rightly; if <hi>Nature, God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> may direct us ſafely, we muſt conclude, That <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity of Words is not only lawful but expedient in the exerciſe of Godlineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. I ſhall prove <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity of Words</hi> neceſſary and expedient by <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. And Reaſon it ſelf will tell us (if we have not abjured it) that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> in <hi>Words</hi> is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and conducing to the practice of <hi>Godlineſs;</hi> for take this away, and ſee what giddineſs and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractedneſs muſt neceſſarily enſue in every Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
                  <p>Without agreement in theſe things, to terminate and bound both our <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Words,</hi> how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable is it, that moſt men ſhould be ſecured from inconſiderate wandrings, and unwarrantable expreſſions. But being confined to words of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Devotion,</hi> we call home our <hi>Thoughts</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what theſe import and ſignifie, that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned and preſcribed us, and reverently we <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> God, and <hi>pray</hi> to him, and <hi>confeſs</hi> to his Name.</p>
                  <p>And our wilful Oppoſers give Teſtimony to this Truth by their practice, that <hi>ſet Ferms</hi> muſt be preſcribed to the People.</p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:102499:51"/>
                  <p>When the beſt gifted Brother is appointed and agreed on to put up <hi>Prayers,</hi> which are <hi>ſet Forms</hi> to the whole Congregation; and it is not to be denied, but every Member that is truly <hi>Religious,</hi> ſecretly doth concur with ſuch Prayers, and limit their Thoughts to what is ſignified by ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. Weak Creatures! never conſidering that they ſplit upon that Rock which they pretend ſtudiouſly to avoid, while they voluntarily enſlave themſelves, and ſtint their <hi>ſpirits</hi> and <hi>thoughts</hi> to conform to the ſudden wild effuſions, and oft un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable expreſſions of their idolized Teacher; and dare not ſpoil their Liberty, to ſubmit unto, and concur with the deliberate <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions</hi> of their ſober Governours and Rulers, which will undoubtedly guide and lead them to the right exerciſe of <hi>true Religion</hi> that tends to peace.</p>
                  <p>Poor inconſiderate People, they know not what to do; for it is not a <hi>ſet Form</hi> they hate, which they may ſee they cannot avoid, but a <hi>ſpirit of Contradiction</hi> they love, while they oppoſe the warrantable directions of their Religious Leaders, and willingly ſuffer themſelves to be captivated by wild ungovern'd <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> and run headlong into an inexcuſable ſin of a wilful Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>But if any can think <hi>ſet Forms</hi> to be unlawful, and will be tied to none, but avoid them, then muſt every pretended Saint bring a diſtinct <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Pſalm,</hi> to be poured out by himſelf in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Congregations. And it muſt neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, when every one is ſinging a ſeveral <hi>Pſalm</hi> in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102499:51"/>their Congregation, it muſt happen what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith was at <hi>Corinth, when they all ſpake with ſeveral Tongues,</hi> a Stranger coming in muſt in reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there was <hi>madneſs</hi> in the midſt of them.</p>
                  <p>Thus in <hi>Reaſon</hi> we muſt determine, to terminate and bound the <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Conſiderations</hi> of them that would be truly Religious, there ought to be <hi>ſet Forms of Words</hi> agreed upon and preſcribed in Believing Congregations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That is beſt to be uſed that will moſt heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten our <hi>Devotion</hi> and <hi>Intention</hi> in our Religious addreſſes to God; for how ſhall I hope that God ſhould intend me, if I do not intend my own Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions. And I am verily perſwaded, <hi>Prayer</hi> without <hi>Devotion,</hi> is like a <hi>Body</hi> without a <hi>Soul,</hi> it is dead and ineffectual.</p>
                  <p>Now this I do deliberately affirm and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>That premeditated and ſet Forms of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er muſt heighten any mans Devotion and Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I deſire ſuch as obſtinately oppoſe <hi>premeditated</hi> and <hi>compoſed Forms,</hi> to conſider, that in this they contend only for <hi>freedom of Words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And have <hi>Words</hi> any power or influence over God? Can we imagine, that God is taken with <hi>variety</hi> or <hi>ſhift</hi> of Phraſes? <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>loeutions</hi> are for mans neceſſity, not Gods information. They are of no neceſſity to make our hearts known to him, who underſtand what we need before we ask him, and our Thoughts afar off. And it is the <hi>affections</hi> of our Hearts, not the <hi>expreſſion</hi> of our Mouths, that make us prevail with our God.</p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:102499:52"/>
                  <p>What therefore may beſt conduce to ſettle our <hi>Conſideration,</hi> to fix our <hi>Deſires</hi> and <hi>Intentions</hi> on God, and good things, is moſt lawful and moſt expedient to be uſed. And this, I dare ſay, upon Reaſon and from Experience, is beſt done by well-weighed Forms of <hi>ſet Prayers,</hi> foreknown and aſſented unto both by Prieſt and People.</p>
                  <p>For the operation of one Faculty hinders the operation of another; the imployment of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> and <hi>Invention</hi> muſt hinder the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Devotion.</hi> Sure we muſt acknowledge the buſying of the <hi>Invention</hi> in him that ſpeaketh, and his <hi>Conſideration</hi> in him that heareth, whether things be warrantable or accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table that is ſpoken, or not, muſt hinder the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of either.</p>
                  <p>And ſince <hi>Intention</hi> is more prayer, and more likely to prevail with God than <hi>Elocution,</hi> I may poſſibly buſie my head and ſtrain my Invention, when I go about to pleaſe men, and if poſſible, quicken my Elocution in preaching. But I will ſettle my heart, and fix my Intention, when I go about to intreat or ſpeak to my God.</p>
                  <p>In Reaſon therefore, I muſt conclude, and from Experience avouch it, That <hi>Devotions</hi> united in ſame <hi>Expreſſion,</hi> like Waters ſtreightned in one Channel, run the moſt irreſiſtably; yea, undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly, premeditated and fore-known Expreſſions heighten <hi>Intention</hi> and <hi>Devotion,</hi> and make the Prayers of any Congregation the more acceptable, and the more prevalent with God.</p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:102499:52"/>
                  <p>The Objection is frivolous and weak, which our diſſenting Adverſaries make againſt thoſe <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions</hi> uſed in our <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> as if they did remit and bedead our Affections; when, if rightly conſidered and applyed, they <hi>intend, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven</hi> and <hi>invigorate</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour at the <hi>laſt Agony</hi> in the <hi>Garden,</hi> three times retired himſelf, and <hi>prayed thrice the ſame words,</hi> Mat. 26.44. Sure none dare ſay he wanted ability to alter his Expreſſion, or that he wanted <hi>affection,</hi> though he did not. No ſure, we may ſafely conclude to this Point, That, <hi>as Chriſt, ſo the Chriſtian hath his Devotion helped and not hindered, by a ſet and foreknown expreſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The weakneſs of the People is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; and I appeal to any ſober man to judge, It being to be granted, that the generality of the People are dull of <hi>Apprehenſion,</hi> of <hi>ſlow Judgment,</hi> prone to <hi>inconſiderateneſs,</hi> and <hi>inadvertency;</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ſet Forms,</hi> ſeriouſly fore-weighed, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently digeſted and preſcribed, are not more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Helps of <hi>Devotion,</hi> and better preparations for the Peoples general <hi>Concurrence,</hi> who have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quick <hi>Apprehenſions</hi> nor diſcerning <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> than <hi>extempore, indigeſted,</hi> and <hi>voluntary effuſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The manifold <hi>neceſſities</hi> we are involved in, and <hi>wants</hi> we are ſtreightned with, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of <hi>Mercies</hi> wherewith we are bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and have received, cannot in an inſtant be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to remembrance, and duly be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:102499:53"/>
                  <p>So it is not to be ſuppoſed, that our <hi>Petitions</hi> or <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> can be fully or comprehenſively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed upon <hi>extempore effuſion,</hi> but only upon ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deliberate <hi>premeditation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> It would be good to leave to future times and to other Churches, for their Example, our ſetled <hi>Agreement</hi> and <hi>Conſent,</hi> unanimouſly concurring in the <hi>ſoundneſs</hi> and <hi>incorruptneſs</hi> of our Religion, which we cannot evidence, without we agree in conſtant <hi>

                  <p>If we will follow the practices of all Nations that pretended to Religion, <hi>true</hi> or <hi>falſe.</hi> If we will be guided by the Rules and Directions of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> If we will follow the dictates of diſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive <hi>Reaſon;</hi> we muſt conclude it <hi>lawful, neceſſary,</hi> and <hi>expedient,</hi> and conducing to the practice of <hi>true Piety,</hi> That <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Faith</hi> ſhould be ſignified by <hi>

                  <p>And as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> was to be ſignified by agreement in the ſame Words, ſo by <hi>

From thoſe <hi>Prophecies</hi> that fore-tell what there would be, we may conclude what there ſhould and ought to be expected in the Church of the living God.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt fore-told his <hi>Spouſe</hi> in her Militant ſtate, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.9, 10. ſhould be <hi>an Army under Banners, ſub vexillo Crucis,</hi> whatever diſtraction of an Army, when ſecure, yet when terrible under Banners,

                  <p>And that inlightned Divine, that <hi>ſaw a door opened into Heaven, and a Throne fixed, and one ſitting upon the Throne, and Elders and Angells, ten thouſand times ten thouſand, and thouſands of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, worſhipping him that ſate upon the Throne,</hi> repreſents them to us in their glorious ſtate, as all unanimouſly agreeing, to <hi>fall down, and caſt their Crowns before him that liveth for ever and ever, and all ſaying, Bleſſing, honour, glory and power, &amp;c.</hi> All recorded, without queſtion, to inform us what ought to be our behaviour on Earth, if we would be like them in Heaven, namely, alway to be buſied in a joynt concurrence of acknowledging and worſhipping God, as with the <hi>ſame words,</hi> ſo with the <hi>ſame actions,</hi>

                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:102499:54"/>
                  <p>And if any would yet further defire to ſee this <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> more expreſly urged, by the Apoſtle, upon particular Churches in the Primitive times, let them obſerve St. <hi>Pauls</hi> direction to the Church at <hi>Corinth.</hi> To them he could not write unto as <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> but as <hi>carnal,</hi> and the reaſon was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there were <hi>ſtrifes</hi> and <hi>diviſions,</hi> and that when they came together in the Church of God, they <hi>eat,</hi> and acted diſtractedly, and ſhew'd they were bent more to gratifie the humour of a Party, rather than to preſerve the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of a Society by a well-ordered decency. Shall the Apoſtle praiſe them in this? No, ſuch <hi>meetings were for the worſe, and not the better.</hi> They were to maintain no ſuch cuſtome in the Church of Chriſt, in <hi>that</hi> there were to be no <hi>Diviſions,</hi> but all things were to be done <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently and in order.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> If they would <hi>walk worthy of the Vocation whereunto they were called,</hi> they were to hold <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace.</hi> True indeed, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of ſpirit</hi> is internal, but <hi>Peace</hi> and its <hi>bond,</hi> their <hi>endeavour</hi> and <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> were all external; and it is no more than this, That they would endeavour to hold the <hi>Spirits <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> by their obliged <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. After the Divine Author had ſet out the glorious Priviledges they might expect from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he proceeds to direct them a joynt <hi>profeſſion of Faith,</hi> to a demonſtration of <hi>love,</hi> to a provocation to <hi>good works,</hi> to mutual exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to <hi>Publick meeting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as he to them, ſo to all the reſt of the Churches doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> injoyn, that they ſhould
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102499:54"/>
                     <hi>adorn their Profeſſion;</hi> that their <hi>Converſation</hi> ſhould be <hi>becoming the Goſpel;</hi> that they ſhould <hi>behave themſelves orderly as in the Houſe of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now certainly, it may be concluded both from <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> from the practice of <hi>Saints</hi> in the Church Militant, or Triumphant; That as <hi>internal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of ſpirit</hi> is to be indeavoured after to preſent us blameleſs to God, ſo ſhould <hi>external <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity in words</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> be endeavoured to be preſerved in all believing Congregations.</p>
                  <p>And now I have plainly and perſpicuouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of every Section contained in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and I think convincingly to any ſober Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. I may juſtly complain, that there be too few will believe our Report. <hi>Infaelix infirmitas, ad ſe vocat medicus ut litibus occupatur aegrotus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> is praiſed of many<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, but very few endeavour to preſerve it; And, <hi>Wo is me that I am conſtrained to dwell in</hi> Meſech, <hi>and have my habitation among the Tents of</hi> Kedar. <hi>My ſoul hath long dwelt with them that are enemies to Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now I ſpeak for peace, I look that ſome are ready to prepare themſelves for battle. I look that that which is the lot of many good Phyſicians, ſhould be mine at this time, that although my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign (God knows) is not to torture my ſick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, but to heal them; that ſome like fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Patients ſhould run from me, and that others now but touched ſhould cry out of me.</p>
                  <p>Many, either inſenſible of their ſickneſs, or elſe in love with their diſtemper, are not only careleſs but backward to be cured. I ſee and bewail it, that many men are miſerably wounded with,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102499:55"/>and yet I juſtly lament it, that I find a great unwillingneſs in moſt of them to be Healed.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Faith,</hi> How many men either out of <hi>weakneſs,</hi> or <hi>partiality,</hi> or <hi>prejudice,</hi> or <hi>intereſt,</hi> or <hi>acquaintance,</hi> have eſpouſed raſhly a wilful Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and ſet it up and idolize it. And this fancy, <hi>Opinion,</hi> perhaps <hi>Perſwaſion,</hi> they ſhall cry up and publiſh it abroad for <hi>Conſcience, Judgment, Faith.</hi> For which, God knows, if examined, they have not the leaſt ſhadow of a Rule, or appearance of Reaſon. So I may complain with St. <hi>Hilary, ad Conſtant. Aug. Facta eſt fides, fides temporum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius quam Evangeliorum periculoſum; &amp; miſerabile, tot nunc fides exiſtere, quot voluntates. Excidêrunt ab eâ fide quae ſola eſt, &amp; dum multae fiunt, ad id coeperunt eſſe ne ulla ſit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I lament that, too apparently to be ſeen in our daies, what the Holy Father complains was to be found in his, <hi>viz. That the</hi> Faith <hi>among us is the Faith of the</hi> Times <hi>rather than the Faith of the</hi> Goſpel. <hi>It is very dangerous and miſerable, that there ſhould be among us as many</hi> Faiths <hi>as</hi> Wills, <hi>and as many</hi> Conſciences <hi>as obſtinate</hi> Reſolutions.</p>
                  <p>They have departed from that Faith which is <hi>One,</hi> and while they pretend to have many Faiths, they ceaſe to keep any. And if it be rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, what <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Conſcience</hi> is, there is ſcarce any true knowledge, or practice, of either to be found in too great a part of our Generation.</p>
                  <p>I hear the words frequently among us, but I muſt publiſh it, that I do not underſtand them; <hi>May I not have liberty of Conſcience? May I not differ in Judgment from other men, and yet agree
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102499:55"/>in Affection? May we not go ſeveral waies, and yet meet together at the end of our Journey?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Were ever any ſuch things reaſonably vented in a Conſtituted Church? Have not the men loſt both <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> that dare confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publiſh theſe things? Can there be ſuch a thing as <hi>Liberty of Conſcience?</hi> Are they not abſolutely inconſiſtent? Conſider, and it muſt be acknowledged, If thou haſt <hi>Conſcience</hi> of any thing thou haſt no Liberty; if thou haſt <hi>Liberty</hi> there can be no Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>May not men differ in <hi>Judgment</hi> and yet agree in <hi>Affection?</hi> What, <hi>ad idem,</hi> in reſpect to the ſame thing? certainly, No; it is impoſſible. If I judge a thing <hi>lawful</hi> and thou judgeſt the ſame thing <hi>unlawful,</hi> our Affections muſt differ as much as <hi>love</hi> and <hi>hate,</hi> and certainly theſe are contrary Affections.</p>
                  <p>Can we not go ſeveral waies, and yet meet at the end of our Journey? certainly, No. The end of our Journey we both tend to is agreed on to be <hi>Heaven, Happineſs.</hi> Now if <hi>Vertue</hi> be the right way to Happineſs, and that lies in a ſtrait line, as <hi>Morality</hi> teaches us, ſure there can be no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining this Line but there muſt be <hi>obliquity.</hi> If the Way to Heaven be <hi>narrow</hi> and <hi>ſtreight on,</hi> as <hi>Divinity</hi> teaches us, thou canſt not go beſides this Way but thou wilt at laſt fall headlong into the Ditch. We muſt both of us keep the ſame <hi>way,</hi> or elſe one of us muſt be in the <hi>broad way that leads to deſtruction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Affection,</hi> where can we find that in a Family, much leſs in a Pariſh or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation?
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102499:56"/>If ever the Complaint was true it is now in our daies, that <hi>Fratrum concordia rara eſt.</hi> We are all pretending to travel with the ſame deſign from <hi>Egypt</hi> to our Father in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and we are Brethren, but how few of us look to the Charge given us? How few are they that take heed that they do not <hi>fall out in the way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There be two Graces that Chriſt commends to us as the <hi>way</hi> to the kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> but inſtead of theſe we ſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Contention.</hi> All pretended Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſts body, yet no ſympathy, no <hi>bearing one anothers burthen.</hi> We are ready to laugh at each others <hi>infirmity,</hi> and to rejoyce at each others <hi>miſery.</hi> Our <hi>iniquity</hi> aboundeth, and <hi>love</hi> waxeth cold. Our diſtinguiſhing Garment is rent clean in pieces, which ſhould be our <hi>Charity,</hi> and that is the <hi>bond of perfectneſs.</hi> This mans hope is that mans fear. One mans joy is another mans ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
                  <p>And as we can hardly find <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in Judgment,</hi> or <hi>Affections,</hi> ſo rare it is to ſee <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity in Words</hi> or <hi>Actions.</hi> For words inſtead of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what difference, what oppoſition? And for thoſe that ſeparate from the Communion of the viſible Church of <hi>England,</hi> where can we find that Congregation that agrees to ſpeak the ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>We dwell among People of a ſtrange Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. The <hi>Trumpets</hi> have given, from moſt Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, an <hi>uncertain ſound,</hi> and how can the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers agree to prepare themſelves to the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:102499:56"/>
                  <p>We may obſerve, many of our Prieſts have been lingring to offer <hi>ſtrange Fires,</hi> ſuch wild ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and inconſiderate excurſions, as inſtead of helping have diverted our Devotions and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted our Affections.</p>
                  <p>And for <hi>Actions</hi> inſtead of <hi>decency</hi> and <hi>order,</hi> what diſtraction, yea, what confuſion in all our ſeparated Congregations. By appearance one would judge them of <hi>Babel</hi> rather than of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> Such diſtractions, as if every one had a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar God by himſelf; or rather, ſuch univerſal <hi>profaneneſs</hi> or <hi>irreverence,</hi> as if no God were thought of as preſent throughout their whole Congregations.

                  <p>I heartily lament many <hi>Crying ſins</hi> that are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſpreading over the body of this poor Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet, upon ſober Conſideration, I cannot judge any ſin ſo manifeſtly deſtructive to the health and beauty of the believing Society, and Church of <hi>England,</hi> as is this of <hi>Schiſme</hi> and <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

                  <p>There is no one ſin that tyrannizeth more over us, but we may ſay to <hi>Schiſm,</hi> as the Pirate did once ſay to <hi>Alexander, Thou blameſt and condemneſt me for preying on ſingle Perſons, and accounteſt thy ſelf without fault, while thou deſtroyeſt a whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

                  <p>GOD, who by his wiſe Providence governs all the works of his hands, rules them all by a <hi>Law.</hi> And Governours ſubordinate, as appointed and ſent by him, are to govern Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional men, joyned in Society under them, by a <hi>Law</hi> alſo.</p>
                  <p>As God in the World, ſo Chriſt in his Church, complying with the <hi>Neceſſities</hi> and <hi>Infirmities</hi> of his Subjects, hath given <hi>Rules</hi> to direct them in <hi>Faith, Devotion</hi> and <hi>Converſation,</hi> by that New Law, which is the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> by which ſuperintendent Frame of Government, his ſubordinate Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours are to govern his <hi>Church</hi> to the end of the World.</p>
                  <p>And ſo according to that <hi>New Law,</hi> Chriſts De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties are to eſtabliſh Laws of <hi>Piety</hi> and Laws of <hi>Honeſty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are now in this part of our Treatiſe to ſpeak of thoſe Laws that reſpect <hi>Piety;</hi> and according to the two parts whereof Man conſiſts, ſome Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of <hi>Piety</hi> muſt concern our Souls, and ſome our Bodies.</p>
                  <p>The Injunctions of Governours that direct to purity of hearts and ſpirits, may be called <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, Monitions.</hi> They cannot properly be called
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102499:58"/>the Laws of <hi>Governours,</hi> but Laws of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for they cannot oblige the <hi>Souls</hi> of the Subjects ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>rewards</hi> or <hi>puniſhments,</hi> having no cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance when they obey, or when they rebel, when they heartily like or diſlike ſuch Injunctions. <hi>Chriſt</hi> can only reward theſe according to their hidden works.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Rules</hi> of ſenſible things, for ordering mens <hi>words</hi> or <hi>actions,</hi> thoſe are properly called the Laws of <hi>Governours;</hi> for of theſe they can make diſcovery. The <hi>obſervance</hi> or <hi>omiſſion</hi> of theſe things are diſcernable by Rulers, and according to the Merits of their Subjects ſo they can recompence them.</p>
                  <p>And let no ſober Perſon think, that <hi>Laws</hi> about external demeanour, or decent behaviour of our Bodies in our Religious attendances, are ſuch tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, toyes, needleſs Circumſtances, childiſh, inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Ceremonies, as many irrationally and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderately defame them, when they are natural and neceſſary for our <hi>Communion</hi> in our preſent condition; when true Grace <hi>operates,</hi> the light within us <hi>directs,</hi> and the Holy Spirit <hi>delights</hi> in theſe things, being willing to admit of our <hi>Bodies</hi> to be his Temple; when theſe <hi>Veſſels</hi> are to be poſſeſſed in <hi>ſanctification</hi> and <hi>honour.</hi> And God hath called us not to <hi>uncleanneſs,</hi> but <hi>holineſs</hi> of theſe things.</p>
                  <p>When Chriſt, by his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> hath ordered the hearing and preaching of his <hi>Word,</hi> the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration and receiving the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding our <hi>Converſations</hi> and <hi>Words,</hi> by which we are either juſtified or condemned.

                  <p>And certainly, an imputation of <hi>Raſhneſs</hi> and <hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe GOD, who is not a God of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion</hi> but of <hi>Order,</hi> a God not of <hi>Diviſion</hi> but of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> is beſt pleaſed and moſt glorified when no man draws back, but when without diſtraction there is an Univerſal diſcovery of every mans evident re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to him. <hi>When the Tribes go up, the Tribes of the Lord, unto the Teſtimony of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>to give thanks unto the Name of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thus <hi>Neighbours</hi> are moſt edified. Conſent and agreement of others with us, give a pleaſure
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102499:59"/>and content to us. It gives a confirmation to our <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> when we receive appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and allowance from the practice of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thus <hi>Infidels</hi> are moſt likely to be wrought upon and converted. One mans preaching may make a man conſider, but certainly it cannot have ſo great an influence as the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> of a whole believing Congregation. We are ready to think thoſe things not hurtful but beneficial, which we ſee <hi>univerſally</hi> practiſed; and we are eaſily drawn to the practice of thoſe things which we ſee gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally allowed and uſed by others.</p>
                  <p>So that, if a man be converted or unconverted, <hi>joynt Concurrence</hi> in Common Service, and the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> Worſhip of God, is more to be valued than any one mans Preaching, being of a greater influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and of a ſtronger operation.</p>
                  <p>Since therefore we ſpeak of a viſible Church, be it <hi>Catholick, National,</hi> or <hi>Parochial,</hi> it is <hi>Coetus evocatorum,</hi> a Company of Men called, not <hi>inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, internally,</hi> but <hi>externally, ſenſibly,</hi> and ſuch as have manifeſted their complyance with that Call. Not a Company but a Society of Believers joyned together by a mutual profeſſion of Faith.</p>
                  <p>For as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of a ſincere Faith is neceſſary for the Conſtitution of the Church <hi>inviſible,</hi> ſo is <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of profeſſion of Faith neceſſary for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and being of a <hi>viſible</hi> Church. And to avoid raſh unanſwerable <hi>expreſſions,</hi> and unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>behaviour,</hi> it is both reaſonable and neceſſary that <hi>words</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> ſhould be reaſonably agreed upon and determined.</p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:102499:60"/>
                  <p>The <hi>thoughts</hi> of our Souls, like the <hi>eyes</hi> of our Bodies, without an Object to terminate them, will wander to the ends of the Earth; therefore the prime work of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> in the Rational Soul, is to ſet God before the eyes of its Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. That, upon ſerious conſideration, ſeeing and concluding him the <hi>Beſt</hi> and the <hi>Greateſt,</hi> man may rationally both think and ſpeak moſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably of him, and behave himſelf moſt reverently towards him.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> then in Religious exerciſes, of neceſſity there muſt be the ſame Object; GOD, who is infinite, muſt be propoſed. That our <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations</hi> and <hi>reſpects</hi> may be terminated upon him. And of neceſſity there muſt be <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Forms</hi> agreed upon and fixed, to direct and limit all aſſociated Profeſſors, that their <hi>conſiderations</hi> and <hi>reſpects</hi> may be united either in knowing God or worſhipping him.</p>
                  <p>Circumſtances cannot be left indefinite and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined; for mans <hi>Thoughts</hi> are as diverſe, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, as their Faces and Tempers. Their <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> uſually wild and extravagant, and not only different but contrary alſo; unleſs all theſe be bounded and terminated, what <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> can there be? An arbitrary Will-worſhip will follow, according to every mans fancy; and in every meeting inſtead of a well-ordered Unity, there muſt neceſſarily happen <hi>diſtraction</hi> and <hi>confuſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And theſe things are obvious to every man that rationally conſiders them; for never any Nation that had <hi>Religion</hi> true or falſe, but alwaies agreed on a Common Miniſtration. And in all their
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102499:60"/>Sacrifices, either <hi>propitiatory</hi> or <hi>gratulatory,</hi> they have united together by certain <hi>Rules</hi> in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Service, and a joynt concurrence in it, to that Deity which they adored.</p>
                  <p>And certainly, all thoſe Reaſons formerly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged to urge an open <hi>profeſſion of Faith,</hi> return with new vigour, ſtrictly to oblige every Viſible Church, to acknowledge the neceſſity of fixing and obſerving <hi>Rules of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Congregation. That the infinite Majeſty of GOD may be generally and worthily glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: That our <hi>Neighbours</hi> and our ſelves, may be moſt probably edified and comforted: That thoſe that are <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers</hi> may have their Converſion beſt furthered; there muſt be <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Forms</hi> preſcribed by Rulers to carry on a general Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this Section then, Governours muſt Rule by a <hi>Law;</hi> their Laws can reach only to <hi>Externals</hi> in the exerciſe of Godlineſs. In which <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of Godlineſs, the firſt aim of Governours by their Laws, is to promote <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> in Religious Aſſemblies. To ſettle and continue an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> there muſt be <hi>Rules</hi> to limit and direct.</p>

                  <head>SECT. II. <hi>That the Canons and Forms in our Liturgy, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the ends above-mentioned, are moſt agreeable to the Rules of the Goſpel, is the next conſiderable.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>LITURGY in its etymologie, if rightly underſtood, gives its full import and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. It is a <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Rule</hi> of Adminiſtration in ſome publick Office.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it is put in Scripture for Miniſtration in offices of <hi>Humanity</hi> and <hi>Liberality.</hi> But our diſcourſe and common Acceptation leads us, to take it for that kind of <hi>Miniſtration</hi> that relates to <hi>Holy things</hi> about the Service and worſhip of God. So here we underſtand it to be, <hi>the Canons and Forms preſcribed in a Viſible Church, of external profeſſion of Faith, by an evident demonſtration of Obedience.</hi> For, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>quod fit per populum, &amp; ſit publicum,</hi> a publick, Religious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration in a Congregation of Believers. So the People muſt be underſtood concerned in the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration</hi> as well as the Prieſt. And thoſe of the People that would be accounted of the Viſible Church, are to ſubmit and conform to ſuch <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Forms</hi> as are preſcribed in the Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>And when a Church is not an Aſſembly only, but a Society of the <hi>Faithful;</hi> not <hi>internally</hi> Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102499:61"/>only (for that is not diſcernible by us) but <hi>externally</hi> by publick Profeſſion, either by <hi>words</hi> or <hi>actions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What our Judgments muſt be of them, that in Aſſemblies neglect and deſpiſe <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> according to Rules preſcribed, is eaſily to be concluded: For whatever good opinion others blindly may have of ſuch, or they may have of themſelves, yet, not giving in their Aſſemblies any evident ſigns of <hi>external Profeſſion,</hi> they are in reaſon not to be judged of the Viſible Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And this ſhews, how unjuſtifiable the <hi>Meetings</hi> of our Separatiſts are, when there is no <hi>publick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Religion,</hi> no <hi>vocal confeſſion of Faith,</hi> no <hi>expreſs deſires of Obedience,</hi> in any of their Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</p>
                  <p>To give evidence of any Aſſembly, that it is a part of the Viſible Church, there muſt be a ſenſible <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> an apparent ſubmiſſion to the <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Forms</hi> of a Liturgy. And conformity of the People to thoſe <hi>Rules,</hi> gives ſatisfaction who are to be reputed; but wilful omiſſion and neglect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares who are not to be reputed of the <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt. And bleſſed be God, we have, as it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and expedient, from our wiſe Governours, conſidering our infirmities and extravagancies, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> and <hi>Forms</hi> preſcribed in our Liturgy for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Miniſtration, which are moſt agreeable to the Rules of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Rules</hi> of the Goſple, given by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, are of ſo different natures, ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſorts: The <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Forms</hi> ordering our Common-Service, in the publick exerciſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102499:62"/>are ſo numerous and various, as it were the work of an Age to diſcourſe diſtinctly and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently of every particular, that may be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this Section. But firſt let us conſider what we underſtand by the <hi>Rules</hi> of the Goſpel, to which our <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
                  <p>Now our Bleſſed Saviour, at the firſt planting of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> (upon the Apoſtles and Seventy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Paſſion, and upon ſome Choſen Veſſels for his Honour, after his Aſcenſion having all power given him) did in thoſe daies plentifully pour out his <hi>Spirit</hi> upon them, and <hi>gifts, graces</hi> and <hi>ability</hi> he gave to them in an extraordinary manner and meaſure, for the work of the Miniſtery and edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Body, by the prevalence of his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which he ſent them abroad to preach, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the Word by ſigns following.</p>
                  <p>That the whole power of the World was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reſiſt the wiſdom and Spirit by which they ſpake, divers Gifts he diſtributed of miraculous operation. For different Adminiſtrations; as <hi>Gifts of Healing, working of Miracles, Propheſying, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of Spirits, diverſe kinds of Tongues, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Tongues.</hi> All theſe in an inſtant wrought that one and ſelf ſame Spirit, dividing to every man ſeverally as he pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>And ſeveral <hi>Rules</hi> he gave them, that truſting to the ſupply of the Almighty in all their exigence, upon this Heavenly deſign, they ſhould <hi>provide nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gold nor Silver, nor Scrip, nor Coat, nor Shooes, nor Staves.</hi> No care what to ſpeak, <hi>dabitur in illâ borâ;</hi> whatever they needed, the Heavenly Father
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102499:62"/>that called them to the work, would ſupply them in all thoſe things.</p>
                  <p>But theſe Rules were <hi>extraordinary,</hi> and ſo were the <hi>Aſſiſtances</hi> needful only for thoſe Perſons, in thoſe daies of <hi>Perſecution</hi> when they were <hi>hated of all men for his Names ſake,</hi> and were to truſt only to a ſupport and a ſupply from the <hi>All-ſufficiency</hi> of the Almighty.</p>
                  <p>But, bleſſed be God, we are not now incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with theſe <hi>ſtreights,</hi> God hath provided better things for us. That although the malice of ſome men would bring us to walk according to theſe <hi>Rules,</hi> and ſupport our ſelves with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of ſuch <hi>Aſſiſtances,</hi> and thoſe miſtakes have cauſed no little diſturbance in the Church of Chriſt; yet, now the <hi>Goſpel</hi> hath found a free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage and reception, we have an happier juncture of Affairs.</p>
                  <p>We need not expect <hi>Miracles</hi> for our ſupport, when we have <hi>Means</hi> in peace afforded us to carry on the deſign of God. <hi>God</hi> is, and <hi>we</hi> may well be contented with more reaſonable Services. And it is unreaſonable to think, having none of the ſame neceſſity upon us, and to conclude, that in <hi>theſe</hi> daies the ſame <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Aſſiſtances</hi> ſhould be continued among us, is a dangerous and an unſufferable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
                  <p>Theſe extraordinary <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Aſſiſtances</hi> were given to thoſe particular Perſons, during thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Times; but they are now unpracticable, and not according to the mind of Chriſt. And there were ſome <hi>Rules</hi> given to certain Churches, and ſome particular places, but theſe are not our
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102499:63"/>
                     <hi>Canons</hi> or <hi>Forms</hi> to be modelled by. The <hi>Rules</hi> then of the Goſpel we are to look after, are not <hi>particular</hi> but <hi>univerſal,</hi> not <hi>temporary</hi> but <hi>eternal,</hi> binding for ever to the whole Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now, the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Goſpel given by Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, are of two ſorts; ſome reſpect <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally,</hi> the regulating <hi>Intentions, Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Deſires,</hi> for private Perſons, ſingular peace: And ſome reſpect <hi>externally,</hi> ordering the <hi>Converſation</hi> of the Viſible Church of Chriſt. To the <hi>Rules</hi> of this latter ſort we muſt have regard unto, in this preſent diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>And theſe <hi>Rules</hi> are of two ſorts; either <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, neceſſary, eternal</hi> and <hi>indiſpenſable,</hi> and would have been binding if Chriſt had not revived them; As, that <hi>we praiſe God, fall down and worſhip him;</hi> that <hi>we keep our Tongues from evil, and our Lips that they ſpeak no guile;</hi> that <hi>we keep our Bodies from all filthineſs;</hi> that <hi>whatever we would that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould do to us, the ſame, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome <hi>Laws</hi> are <hi>poſitive</hi> and <hi>voluntary,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving their being and conſtitution from Chriſt, whoſe <hi>goodneſs, wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> we are not to ſuſpect, but that he will direct thoſe things to his Church that are beſt and moſt convenient, and ſuch <hi>Directions,</hi> by his Subjects, are carefully to be obſerved; As, that <hi>they ſhould pray in theſe words; receive the Sacraments with thoſe ſigns and manner of Communication required.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe poſitive Laws of Chriſt are <hi>univerſal, indiſpenſable,</hi> and though the poſitive Laws of Men are <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>mutable</hi> upon inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102499:63"/>yet theſe <hi>poſitive Laws</hi> of Chriſt are conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, and come from ſuch unqueſtionable Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as they muſt be accounted <hi>univerſally</hi> and <hi>eternally</hi> binding to his Church, to all Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Laws</hi> then of Chriſt, be they either thoſe <hi>natural Laws</hi> that he revived, or the <hi>poſitive Laws</hi> that he conſtituted, that he hath <hi>ordinarily, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally, eternally,</hi> left his Church to be ruled by to the end of the World, are the Laws we would have our <hi>Canons,</hi> for Uniformity, to be tryed by.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe our Bleſſed Saviour knew very well, that an <hi>Anarchy</hi> was unnatural, and not to be endured, he wiſely directs theſe Laws to two ſorts of People that will be in his Church to the end of the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> To <hi>Rulers, Leaders</hi> and <hi>Superiours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> To <hi>Inferiours, Subjects</hi> and the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality</hi> of the People under Authority.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For <hi>Rulers,</hi> They be of two ſorts; ſome <hi>Civil,</hi> which we call <hi>Magiſtrates:</hi> Others <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical,</hi> which we call <hi>Miniſters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What concerns <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> we treated of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Miniſters</hi> we have ſeveral Orders, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, allowed by the Goſpel. The <hi>Laws</hi> for them are obvious, in the diſcharge of their ſeveral Offices.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Inferiour Miniſters</hi> moſt concern us in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Religion. Theſe, if any, we ſhould in this diſcourſe reſpect. And certainly, that Obedience which theſe Miniſters ſhew in their uſages, as
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:102499:64"/>directed in their <hi>Rites, Ceremonies, Habits, Geſtures, obſerving daies, &amp;c.</hi> are lawful and eaſily juſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>And theſe things are made ſo clear by the pens of ſober, Learned and Judicious men, to any that will not be wilfully blind, all the Objections ſo fully anſwered, as it would be tedious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent for me to inſiſt in a further Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>It were more reaſonable and Chriſtianlike if men would look more diligently to the diſcharge of their own duties, and be leſs ready to cenſure and condemn other mens Juſt obſervances. If any thing were queſtionable in them, <hi>viderint ipſi,</hi> they muſt anſwer it to their proper Judge, who made thee one?</p>
                  <p>Be not curiouſly inquiſitive what others do, or ſhould do, <hi>Tolle quod tuum eſt,</hi> do thy own buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſeriouſly conſider what thou art bound to do thy ſelf, that thou maiſt inherit <hi>eternal life.</hi> And this I am ſure thou art obliged to do; <hi>to give thy Decent attendance, and joyntly to concur in the Publick exerciſe of Holineſs, and the worſhip of God, as it is ordered in the Book of Common-Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now our diſcourſe begins to be brought into a narrow compaſs. This is all that remains for us to prove in this Section, That the <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Forms</hi> preſcribed to the Common ſort of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, in our Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the univerſal, eternal, and indiſpenſable <hi>Rules</hi> of the Goſpel,</p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:102499:64"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Canons</hi> for Uniformity, in our Religious meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Aſſemblies which we are not to forſake, reſpect either <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Actions,</hi> let us take a quick ſurvey of either, and ſee if both be not allowed and preſcribed by the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After a Company is Religiouſly met and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together, all admit and approve of a <hi>Paſtour</hi> or <hi>Teacher,</hi> an Exhorter, a Leader to holy Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, unleſs they have loſt their Reaſon and Religion alſo.</p>

                  <p>After Preparation, the whole Congregation is ordered and directed to joyn in an <hi>open Confeſſion,</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> Excellency and All-ſufficiency, of their <hi>own</hi> Sins, of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Merits, in whoſe Name they ask <hi>forgiveneſs,</hi> and of their deſire of a <hi>full Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> that they may live a godly, righteous and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber life.</p>
                  <p>After this, upon good grounds, is denounced <hi>Abſolution of ſins,</hi> upon the intimation of their unanimous deſires to leave and forſake them.</p>
                  <p>Then all the People joyn in the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> Confeſſion of Praiſe and Thanks to the glory of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> into whoſe Name they were all Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
                  <p>Then they proceed to <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Pſalms,</hi> to mutual Exhortations, and ſtirring up each in other holy Affections.</p>
                  <p>Then follows <hi>vocal Confeſſion of Faith;</hi> a <hi>Litany</hi> they all joyn in, deprecating all <hi>evil,</hi> praying for all <hi>good,</hi> for themſelves and all men.</p>

                  <p>Then they proceed to give intimation of their mutual deſires and reſolutions, of a full obedience and reſpect to all Gods <hi>Commandements.</hi>

                  <p>AND, how ſhall we be able to maintain theſe the Beſt, which ſome will not grant to be good at all?</p>
                  <p>The Herd of <hi>Seciaries</hi> are all of them nibbling at our <hi>Liturgy.</hi> Their work is to <hi>defame,</hi> and if they can, to <hi>deſtroy;</hi> yet of all things, they moſt virulently aim at the Publick <hi>Service</hi> of the Church.</p>
                  <p>We remember with grief enough what late ſtorm brought theſe Locuſts; but yet we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, no contrary wind hath driven them quite away, there are yet too many in our Coaſts.</p>
                  <p>We hear them ſtill maliciouſly and unreaſonably Object:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That our</hi> Liturgy <hi>is taken out of the</hi> Romiſn Miſſal; <hi>the greater part of it is Popiſh Trumpery; the Papiſts uſe it, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Malice,</hi> whoſe end is alwaies to wound and do miſchief, never boggles to compaſs it by the moſt unlawful means. What ſhe can never hope to bring about by publiſhing <hi>truths,</hi> ſhe is ready to attempt by raiſing <hi>ſlanders</hi> and <hi>falſe ſuggeſtions.</hi> For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly none that are not wilfully ignorant, but muſt acknowledge, that moſt of our <hi>Prayers, Confeſſions,</hi>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:102499:66"/>and <hi>Reſponſes,</hi> uſed in our Divine Service, are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken either out of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> or out of the <hi>Liturgies</hi> of the Primitive and pureſt Ages, before ever the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> had exalted it ſelf, or proudly had uſurped the Supremacy and Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip above the Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe it be granted, what we cannot deny, That many things are uſed in our <hi>Liturgy</hi> by us, which are to be found in the <hi>Romiſh Miſsal</hi> or <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viary,</hi> the queſtion is, whether the things be good and lawful of themſelves or not? Doubtleſs, we are not to forbear things that are good and lawful, becauſe <hi>bad men</hi> make uſe of them; then we muſt not uſe either <hi>meat,</hi> or <hi>drink,</hi> or <hi>cloth,</hi> or <hi>Sun;</hi> we muſt neceſſarily go quite out of the World.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall thankfully partake of the <hi>meat</hi> that is wholſome, although <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>unclean men</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times eat of it. I ſhall willingly embrace any <hi>holy Truth,</hi> though confeſſed by the <hi>Father of Lies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſee <hi>light</hi> and <hi>darkneſs</hi> may be in the ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <hi>health</hi> and <hi>ſickneſs</hi> in the ſame Body, <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> are in the ſame Perſons.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall pluck a <hi>wholſome Herb,</hi> and make uſe of it, though I find it in a dirty Ditch: I'le throw away a <hi>poyſonous Weed,</hi> though in a Garden.</p>
                  <p>And, if I can diſcern, I ſhall decline what is <hi>bad,</hi> though I ſee it in the moſt Vertuous; and follow what is <hi>good,</hi> though in the moſt Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Evil men</hi> give good gifts to their Children; If <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Papiſts</hi> offer to God a ſacrifice of Praiſe,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:102499:66"/>and uſe ſuch <hi>words</hi> or <hi>actions</hi> as may beſt promote tke right exerciſe of true Religion; I ſhall think it my duty, in all things that are <hi>good</hi> and <hi>lawful,</hi> to follow them.</p>
                  <p>Object. 2. <hi>In our Liturgy are</hi> (they ſay) <hi>vain Repetitions, dead Sacrifices, empty Forms; void of that life and affection which is neceſſary for Gods ſervice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, who does not ſee the <hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>malice</hi> of our Oppoſers in this Accuſation, charging the fault upon the <hi>Forms,</hi> which is properly laid upon them that inconſiderately make uſe of them. For the vanity is in the <hi>Perſons</hi> that are careleſs, not in the <hi>Repetitions,</hi> if rightly attended. For, if thou beeſt well diſpoſed, <hi>Repetitions</hi> will awaken thy <hi>Conſideration,</hi> and not becalm or bedead, but quicken and heighten <hi>Devotion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Deadneſs of Affection</hi> is a fault, but certainly the <hi>Forms</hi> or <hi>Repetitions</hi> are not guilty of it; the fault is in thy <hi>heedleſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis not juſt to impute that fault to the <hi>Offering,</hi> that is in <hi>thy ſelf</hi> that art to tender it.</p>
                  <p>Thou who wilfully oppoſeſt thy <hi>ſelf,</hi> reſtrain thy wild, wandring <hi>Thoughts,</hi> ſummon thy <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> baniſh thy <hi>Dulneſs,</hi> quicken thy <hi>Devotion,</hi> never doubt it, all will ſucceed well in uſing theſe <hi>Forms;</hi> I dare ingage, both thou and thy ſacrifice will be accepted.</p>
                  <p>Object. 3. <hi>They are offended at the length of the Prayers. For uſing all the Forms as they are preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in our</hi> Liturgy, <hi>takes up</hi> (ſay they) <hi>too much Time, that the Gifted man hath not his full liberty of exerciſing himſelf in preaching, with which the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102499:67"/>godly People are moſt delighted. Common-Prayer would be omitted, or ſhortned, that Sermon may not be hindred.</hi> This they take for granted, that <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi> is to be preferred before <hi>Praying.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Allegation is falſe and ridiculous in every particular. For, the <hi>Forms</hi> preſcribed are not too long, nor ſo long as they neceſſarily hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Preaching;</hi> both may very conveniently be done.</p>
                  <p>But, what if the <hi>Gifted man</hi> were hindred from offering his ſtrange Fire, his wild effuſion in <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>Preaching;</hi> Certainly if this were in the compaſs of the length of our <hi>Common-prayers</hi> to be prevented, it would prove not their fault but their commendation.</p>
                  <p>What unhappy Conſequences have happened from Miniſters oftentation of <hi>Eloquence, Parts</hi> and <hi>Gifts,</hi> its notoriouſly evident among us. While the People having their idolized Teachers <hi>Perſons</hi> in Admiration, they have divided into Factions and Parties, and have diſturbed the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the moſt flouriſhing Church of the World.</p>
                  <p>And if it be ſeriouſly conſidered, what unſound <hi>Doctrines,</hi> what diſtracting <hi>Notions,</hi> what perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Opinions,</hi> what erronious and <hi>Dividing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> have been publiſhed and entertained of late years in the midſt of us?</p>
                  <p>It cannot be unreaſonably concluded, That there ſhould be limits and boundaries ſet, in this preſent juncture of Affairs, to reſtrain the wildneſs of ſome mens <hi>Preaching</hi> as well as <hi>Praying,</hi> certainly would much conduce to the ſetling of <hi>Order</hi> and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102499:67"/>
                     <hi>Peace</hi> both in Church and Nation.</p>
                  <p>But, if as <hi>Common-prayer</hi> is wiſely injoyned, ſo <hi>Preaching</hi> muſt be freely tolerated, let it be ſoberly conſidered, which of the two, if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do both, is moſt conveniently omitted, either <hi>Prayers</hi> or <hi>Sermon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Prayers</hi> are deliberately compoſed, in <hi>Preaching</hi> there is too oft ſudden and unjuſtifiable effuſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prayers</hi> directly and immediately tend to Gods Honour; <hi>Preaching</hi> oft doth not, but to the diftra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of the People.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Prayers</hi> God is ſerved and worſhipped; by <hi>Preaching</hi> mens humors are gratified and fancies pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Sermons</hi> at beſt, we do but hear what we ſhould do; in <hi>Prayers,</hi> we do what we hear is fit to be done. <hi>Sermons</hi> edifie our knowledge, <hi>Prayers</hi> our practice.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, As much as <hi>doing</hi> is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>hearing, Practice</hi> before <hi>Notion,</hi> the certain knowledge of God before the uncertain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and the humouring our ſelves; ſo much without doubt ought our attendance upon <hi>Praying</hi> to be preferred, before running after <hi>Preaching.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſince it would be little conducing to my own content, or the Chriſtian Readers delight, or the wilful Oppoſers credit, to rake into that pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of <hi>Reproach,</hi> that from unreaſonable <hi>prejudice</hi> they have, falſly and maliciouſly, vomited up againſt our beſt compoſed <hi>Liturgy;</hi> I forbear adviſedly, and declare my Judgment freely under my hand, in the Reverend Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> words, <hi>Ever ſince the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:102499:68"/>Reproaches of men have taken conſidence to vent themſelves againſt our</hi> Liturgy, <hi>there hath been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but</hi> air <hi>and</hi> vapour <hi>vomited out againſt it.</hi> Objections, <hi>of little force to conclude any thing, but reſolute, contumacious</hi> ignorance <hi>or</hi> malice <hi>of the Objectors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For when we conſider, how full our <hi>Liturgy</hi> is of Canons and Forms directing every Believer, in true Religion, to the acknowledging and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of God: That all the <hi>Promiſes</hi> are confeſſed to be relied upon, as the ground of our Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. That all the <hi>Rules</hi> are repeated that are directive to a Goſpel Obedience, and that we ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie our Deſires and Reſolutions to obſerve and conform to them. When all the <hi>Evils</hi> we fear are deprecated, and all the neceſſary <hi>Bleſſings</hi> we can deſire are petitioned for.</p>
                  <p>And when I conſider that <hi>comely Order,</hi> and <hi>decent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> of the whole Society that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to our Churches pure Directions, that upon diligent ſearch, I cannot perceive any of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> paint of <hi>ſuperſtitious, needleſs Ceremonies,</hi> that may cauſe a ſuſpicion of diſhoneſt Intentions. Nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, the leaſt <hi>careleſs, forlorn Irreverence,</hi> that may bring a diſeſteem and contempt upon our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, as is ſeen in the Meetings of our <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> whoſe open Prophaneneſs extract not only a <hi>ſuſpicion,</hi> but a juſt cenſure of the Meeters <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme</hi> and <hi>Infidelity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I muſt conclude with that Bleſſed Martyr, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to our Gracious Soveraign upon the Throne, upon ſearch and diſpute, <hi>That our Liturgy of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>is abſolutely the Beſt, that is viſibly extant to us in the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:102499:68"/>
                  <p>If it were poſſible, it can be neither pleaſure to my ſelf, nor profit to others, to take a ſurvey of all the <hi>Liturgies</hi> that have been and are in the World; to underſtand, compare, weigh, and judge diſtinctly of every of them; to ſet out the redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancies of ſome, and the defect of others; to paſs ſentence, and give preference to what is moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute. This is more than ever any man did fully, or can do, in that ſhort time of his Pilgrimage that is meaſured out unto him.</p>
                  <p>This cannot be expected, nor is it neceſſary; for when our diſcourſe is directed to our Fellow-Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> who are generally Chriſtians of an ordinary Capacity; to caſt an eye upon thoſe <hi>Liturgies</hi> that may fall under their general Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance, may in this caſe ſuffice us.</p>
                  <p>A mans Choice cannot extend beyond the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of his knowledge. We neither chuſe nor refuſe any one thing before another, but we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and diſcern either a ſurpaſſing goodneſs or inconvenience in it. And it is as natural for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſive Creatures to chuſe what is beſt, as to deſire what is good.</p>
                  <p>And for Believing Societies to have <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Forms,</hi> for the People to abide by, is not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient but neceſſary; and this, I dare ſay, hath been proved ſufficiently.</p>
                  <p>Sith then, we of this Church of <hi>England,</hi> as is pretended, have a <hi>Liturgy</hi> preſcribed, in which Diſſenters themſelves can alleadge nothing abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely unlawful; frowardly to lay this quite aſide, or to change it for another, which is leſs uſeful and unwarrantable, is unreaſonable and unnatural.</p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:102499:69"/>
                  <p>For the generality of my Fellow-Subjects to linger after the <hi>Romiſh Maſs</hi> is not to be defended, nor excuſed: For in <hi>Prayers,</hi> or <hi>Praiſes,</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,</hi> how ſhall be that is unlearned concur, ſeeing he doth not clearly underſtand what is ſaid.</p>
                  <p>And the ſame may be ſaid in this caſe in regard of all other <hi>Liturgies</hi> uſed among us; There can be no deſire of them, of which moſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty have little (if any) underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, in the <hi>Romiſh Miſſal</hi> or <hi>Breviary,</hi> how many things of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi> are preſcribed; how many <hi>Confeſſions</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> injoyned, which neither by Scripture or Reaſon can be defended or juſtified, and this by our Learned Pens have been cleared to the World ſufficiently.</p>
                  <p>But for our <hi>Liturgies,</hi> I dare challenge the moſt profeſſed Enemy, the moſt wilful Recuſant, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, if he can, in any immodeſt or light action that is injoyned in any unmeet Expreſſion that is preſcribed.</p>
                  <p>Let them ſay what is <hi>ſuperfluous</hi> or <hi>redundant,</hi> that can be reſcinded. What is <hi>defective</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,</hi> and what ought to be ſupplied and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated.</p>
                  <p>So that upon exact ſcrutiny, I muſt moderately and truly give in this Return, <hi>That the</hi> Canons <hi>and</hi> Forms <hi>in our</hi> Liturgy <hi>are ſo ordered, that they plainly direct the whole Congregations to moſt clear ſignifications of their Religious Intentions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Preparations</hi> at our firſt Aſſembling, are ſuch, as muſt beget in us a holy Reverence and godly fear.</p>

                  <p>Our <hi>Suffrages</hi> ſhort, but indicative of true Piety and Devotion.</p>

                  <p>All our <hi>Common Service,</hi> ſo reaſonably, ſo pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ordered and diſpoſed, as our diſſenting Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies dare not be ſo impudently malicious, as open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to condemn it of ſinfulneſs or unlawfulneſs. Neither can I ever expect (as wiſe as they are in their own eyes) that they will be ſo preſumptuous, as to attempt the preſenting us with a Form of Publick Worſhip, with all the preciſe method of that Order and Decency, that ought to be uſed in it, in which they will pretend to better and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend the excellency of our <hi>Liturgy,</hi> which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and uſed among us.

               <head>SECT. I. <hi>Let us determine and agree, what we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by thoſe Laws, and the Conformity to them, that the Believing Subject of</hi> England <hi>is bound to obſerve.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Governours aim and care is not only at the keeping and diverting from the People what is <hi>grievous</hi> and <hi>inconvenient,</hi> which will render their lives wretched and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but alſo at the compaſſing and injoyning the things that are <hi>good</hi> and <hi>pleaſant,</hi> which make their lives happy and comfortable.</p>
               <p>For theſe two diſtinct ends, there muſt be two diſtinct ſort of Laws. Some <hi>Prohibitive,</hi> forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and reſtraining <hi>Tranſgreſſion,</hi> which is the way to divert Evils feared; ſome <hi>Preceptive,</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to which Laws, the People might attain the <hi>Good</hi> deſigned and propounded.</p>
               <p>And becauſe Man is not to be ſatisfied, barely with <hi>eſcapes</hi> of Evil and Miſery, but with obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a confluence of <hi>Bleſſings,</hi> which may miniſter
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:102499:73"/>ſome competency of <hi>Content</hi> to him in this his preſent condition; therefore he is to make it his buſineſs, not only to reſpect the Laws <hi>Prohibitive,</hi> but thoſe that are <hi>Preceptive</hi> are to be regarded e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially.</p>
               <p>And when we obſerve, the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of Man doth not only depend upon the <hi>love</hi> and <hi>comforts</hi> communicated from his Neighbour, but upon the <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>bleſſings</hi> of God; hence it muſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear, that as man, in a Society, ought to have reſpect to the Laws of <hi>Honeſty,</hi> that he live quietly and comfortably with his Neighbour; ſo is he to regard the Rules that direct him to the practice of true <hi>Piety,</hi> which will make him to walk acceptably before his God. And the <hi>Precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Laws that concern <hi>Piety</hi> ought primarily to be regarded, becauſe the Conforming to them, will bring upon him the Bleſſings of God.</p>
               <p>Now we are to agree to underſtand, that our preſent Diſcourſe relates to Laws of this ſort, <hi>viz. Preceptive Laws of Piety</hi> that are wiſely and piouſly ordered by our Governours, according to Goſpel Rules, that command the <hi>decent</hi> and <hi>reverent</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, and <hi>joynt Concurrence</hi> of every Believing Subject of <hi>England,</hi> in the Uniform exerciſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as in the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> is ordered and preſcribed.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Preceptive Rules</hi> of Uniform worſhip, as in our <hi>Liturgy</hi> the People are directed, are the Laws by us intended, and ought by Believing Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>England,</hi> principally to be regarded, and <hi>conformity</hi> to ſuch Laws ought to be obſerved ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:102499:73"/>
               <p>For as a <hi>Negative Happineſs</hi> will not content us, no more ought a <hi>Negative Holineſs:</hi> ſo a Believers care muſt be, to be truly <hi>vertuous</hi> and <hi>religious.</hi> The holy Soul, that intends a thorough <hi>ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> reſts not ſatisfied that he is not <hi>vicious,</hi> when he knows his being <hi>vertuous</hi> and <hi>truly religious</hi> is that which will pleaſe his God.</p>
               <p>For to ceaſe from evil of <hi>ſin</hi> only, will keep us from evil of <hi>puniſhment</hi> and <hi>judgment</hi> which is threatned; but to do <hi>well,</hi> is that which will bring us to good, and to the <hi>mercies</hi> and <hi>bleſſings</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conformity</hi> then to <hi>Preceptive Rules of Piety</hi> is neceſſary for our <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>well-being,</hi> and one of the principal Duties of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Chriſtian. And the faſhioning and framing of his <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> according to the Canons and Lines in our <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy</hi> preſcribed and directed, is that <hi>Conformity</hi> we now underſtand. That our <hi>Converſes</hi> and <hi>demeanour</hi> in the Worſhip of God, be accommodately orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and commenſurate to the Rules of the <hi>Liturgy.</hi> That none of the lines or lineaments be careleſly pretermitted. That upon our private fancy, no tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor or exuberancy be added ſuperſtitiouſly, that we admit of neither <hi>exceſs</hi> or <hi>defect</hi> that may ſpoil that beauty of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> whereby we may repreſent an exact ſymmetry of parts, according to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Original and Copy which is ſet before us.</p>
               <p>This I mean by that <hi>Conformity</hi> we are to attend and heed. Happy ſhould we be if a People once in ſuch a caſe; yea, bleſſed ſhould we be, if we could thus <hi>decently Worſhip our God.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>THere be two great miſtakes that our Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Fiduciaries are eminently guilty of about Omiſſion. One is, <hi>that omiſſion of Carnal ſins pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibited, Preſents them Saints, and is all the vertue by them deſired;</hi> the other is, <hi>that the omiſſion of external duties of Piety that are commanded, is no ſin, and is not at all feared.</hi> But as pure as this Generation may ſeem in their own eyes, yet in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſes can they make it appear, that they are cleanſed from their wickedneſs, when from the firſt miſtake they ſwell with <hi>Pride,</hi> and from the ſecond miſtake they muſt diſdain <hi>Humility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſay, <hi>They are not open Blaſphemers, nor Riotous, nor Thieves, nor Adulterers, nor Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and we may believe them; yet while this <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Holineſs</hi> content them, they are ready to account themſelves Righteous, and deſpiſe others. Thus they chooſe eaſieſt Duties, and neglect the greater, advance one to the ſuppreſſing of another, and, without regret, ſecurely paſs by obedience to <hi>Preceptive Rules,</hi> and with a partial and piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal <hi>Conformity</hi> they deceive themſelves. But we have otherwiſe learned the mind of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For in reaſon, when <hi>Vertue</hi> lies <hi>in medio,</hi> and is only a ſtreight line and tendency to Happineſs, as
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:102499:74"/>
                  <hi>Morality</hi> teach us; the <hi>defect</hi> as well as the <hi>exceſs,</hi> will keep us from ever coming at this end. And when every Believer is bound to obey the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that expects to enter into the kingdom of Heaven, as <hi>Divinity</hi> teacheth us.</p>
               <p>Certainly, bare <hi>unholineſs, uncharitableneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, unpeacableneſs,</hi> that are but ceſſations and ſuſpenſions of thoſe due Acts that be commanded, and ought not to be left undone, cannot content any true Believer. For no perſon, be he either <hi>Child, Servant,</hi> or <hi>Subject,</hi> if he neglects to do what he is injoyned, but is juſtly looked upon as <hi>diſobedient. To him that knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is ſin,</hi> Jam. 4.17.</p>
               <p>But when <hi>Omiſſion</hi> arrives at that height, to be <hi>wilful,</hi> it become that ſin we would have notified and avoided. When men declare their <hi>love</hi> and <hi>choice,</hi> by an open and continued ſeparation from Holy exerciſes as commanded, ſuch wilful Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is rightly called <hi>Recuſancy;</hi> being an open and declared refuſal of doing that ſervice and holy Duties they are commanded.</p>
               <p>And, if ſeriouſly conſidered, I know not how our Officers, in our ſeveral Pariſhes, can be excuſed or acquitted of the guilt of <hi>Perjury,</hi> when of forty Perſons, that wilfully omit and deſpiſe the <hi>Divine Service</hi> and <hi>Sacrament,</hi> they cannot in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns at Aſſizes, or Seſſions, find one open Recuſant; when certainly, a wilful <hi>Omiſſion</hi> or <hi>Recuſancy</hi> of due Obedience, deſerves both <hi>ſentence</hi> and <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> when it is an <hi>heinous ſin, and Diſobedience.</hi>

               <p>SO much the Nobler the <hi>Law</hi> fixed and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed is, ſo much the greater the ſin, and the more grievous the <hi>tranſgreſſion</hi> of that Law.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Conformity</hi> to the firſt and greateſt Law of <hi>Piety,</hi> is a nobler Vertue than <hi>Conformity</hi> to the Rules of <hi>Charity;</hi> and <hi>averſion</hi> from that Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity muſt be a greater ſin, becauſe then we turn away from GOD, who is infinitely better than <hi>Men,</hi> or any Creature whatſoever.</p>
               <p>The firſt and greateſt Commandment is, <hi>To love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul:</hi> theſe muſt reſpect God indeed; but, <hi>with all thy ſtrength,</hi> this muſt relate to Man. For the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of a viſible Chriſtian is demonſtrable to Man by <hi>outward actions,</hi> when <hi>ſtrength</hi> exerts it ſelf by doing what is Commanded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Omiſſion</hi> therefore, of a viſible exerciſe of <hi>Piety,</hi> muſt be concluded, in reaſon, a ſin of the greateſt ſize, ſince it is a tranſgreſſion of the greateſt <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, Tranſgreſſions of a general, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Law of <hi>Piety,</hi> are greater than the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a ſingle, particular Law, that command a ſingle Duty. But omiſſion of <hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> comprehends all the duties of Chriſtian Obedience, and what doth it profit a man, in a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, to ſay, <hi>he hath Faith,</hi> if he hath no <hi>Works,</hi> and do not make his <hi>faith</hi> appear by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</hi> If we <hi>know</hi> we muſt <hi>acknowledge;</hi> if we <hi>believe</hi> we muſt <hi>ſpeak. He that offends in this</hi> one <hi>point is guilty of all,</hi> Jam. 2.14.</p>
               <p>And, if offending againſt a particular prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law of <hi>Charity,</hi> renders a man guilty of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing every part of that Law, how much more if a man offends a comprehenſive Law of <hi>Piety?</hi> In the Judgment of Man, ſuch a Perſon muſt be lookt upon to have <hi>denied the Faith, &amp;c.</hi> So, if any man would ask, what is the Name of this ſin? it muſt be anſwered <hi>Legion, for they are many.</hi> When moſt of the Commandements of the firſt Table are openly tranſgreſt by this <hi>wilful Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, if deliberately conſidered, it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, That theſe ſins of <hi>wilful Omiſſion</hi> or <hi>Recuſancy</hi> of Obedience, to preceptive Laws of <hi>Piety,</hi> are greater ſins than ſins of <hi>Commiſſion</hi> againſt the prohibitive Laws of the ſecond Table, that concern <hi>Charity,</hi> in reſpect of ſeveral Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that ſuch Tranſgreſſors are involved in, which muſt needs aggravate theſe ſins exceedingly.</p>
               <p>For theſe ſins of <hi>Omiſſion</hi> are open and manifeſt, but thoſe ſins of <hi>Commiſſion</hi> are many times ſecret and hid. Therefore, many times, ſins of <hi>Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> fall under the Judgment of God only; but ſins of <hi>wilful Omiſſion</hi> fall certainly under the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>And, he that judgeth and condemneth his Neighbour for <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> though he judgeth truly, yet he judgeth raſhly and uncharitably, becauſe ſuch ſins are indiſcernible to man; but when <hi>Profaneſs</hi> and <hi>Impiety</hi> are manifeſt by a <hi>wilful Recuſancy,</hi> ſuch ſins go before men to Judgment, and Officers may accuſe and condemn ſuch notorious Crimes, juſtly and warrantably.</p>
               <p>And ſins that are done <hi>impudently</hi> and <hi>ſhameleſly,</hi> are worſe ſins than thoſe that are done <hi>modeſtly</hi> and <hi>cloſely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now beaſtly ſins of <hi>Commiſſion</hi> are committed ſecretly, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.7. they ſeek the <hi>night</hi> to conceal them, and <hi>darkneſs</hi> to cover them. But if men will be openly guilty of their Abominations, and not be at all aſhamed; if they will declare and publiſh their ſins like <hi>Sodom,</hi> and make their Faces harder than a Rock, and refuſe to return, a Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is lawful and juſtifiable upon ſuch <hi>open ſin;</hi> and the Magiſtrate is not juſt that will not take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon ſuch wilful Tranſgreſſours.</p>
               <p>A ſecond aggravation of ſin may be, when a ſin is <hi>Electively</hi> and <hi>voluntarily</hi> committed. For this muſt be confeſſed, that <hi>Vertue</hi> or <hi>Vice</hi> are more or leſs Meritorious, as they are more or leſs Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. A ſin muſt be greater that is upon deliberate <hi>Choice</hi> committed, than that which is done upon <hi>ſurprizal,</hi> through the prevalence of a Temptation, ſuddenly and inconſiderately.</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:102499:76"/>
               <p>Now, ſins of <hi>Commiſſion</hi> have many of theſe Excuſes; Either men are baſely or degenerouſly indulging the Beſtial part, and ſo are tranſported with the preſent impreſſion of ſome ſweet delight that pleaſeth the <hi>ſenſe,</hi> which admits of no <hi>delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> Or elſe through <hi>Pride, Envy, Malice,</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi> which would be ſatisfied, men have hurried headlong into irregular Attempts. Or elſe through a <hi>fawning, flattering Compliance</hi> with the prevalent Humors of the Times, men have been miſled with the Cuſtomary practice of a multitude, and have preſt, like Beaſts, <hi>Non quo eundum, ſed quaitur;</hi> Following bad Example to do evil, and without natural affection, not guided by Reaſon, have fallen into the worſt of ſins of the worſt of Times.</p>
               <p>But now, what Temptation or excuſe can any man alledge or pretend for <hi>wilful Omiſſion,</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſancy?</hi> Other ſinners have had either <hi>pleaſure</hi> or <hi>profit</hi> to quicken the Temptation, and make it more active, and more prevalent; but what fruit, what benefit can the <hi>Recuſant</hi> alleadge for not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is injoyn'd? He abſolutely chooſeth the <hi>evil,</hi> and refuſeth the <hi>good</hi> voluntarily, without Temptation; ſure this ſin is to be accounted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe.</p>
               <p>Another aggravation of a Sin is, when it is done <hi>reſolutely</hi> and <hi>obſtinately.</hi> Now, what is done <hi>reſolutely</hi> and <hi>conſtantly,</hi> if bad, is worſe than what is done <hi>uncertainly,</hi> and <hi>contingently.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, ſins of <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> many of them have their abatement and weakning by Age and Time; but ſins of <hi>Omiſſion</hi> gather ſtrength by continuance, and make man more indiſpoſed to forſake them.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:102499:77"/>
               <p>For ſins of <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> men are aſhamed, weary of them, and forſake them in time; but for ſins of <hi>Omiſſion,</hi> we reſt ſecurely, and delight in them. In this caſe, there's no probability men ſhould take care to be <hi>well,</hi> who never are ſenſible they are <hi>ſick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They make choice of their <hi>Deluſion,</hi> and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly would be given up to the Continuance of their <hi>Abominations.</hi> We ſee their <hi>obſtinacy,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved <hi>impenitency.</hi> And this muſt be accounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother aggravation.</p>
               <p>Another aggravation of a Sin may be, if it be againſt a <hi>Promiſe</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> ſolemnly made to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Every man is bound <hi>ſtare pactis &amp; promiſſis,</hi> ſo it cannot reaſonably be denied, but a <hi>wilful Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of duties of Piety in a Baptized Subject, who hath declared and ſignified firmly his profeſſion of holy Obedience to the Faith, is far worſe than a wilful Omiſſion of a <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Infidel,</hi> that never promiſed obſervance to <hi>Goſpel Rules,</hi> and never made <hi>Profeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. The <hi>wilful ſin</hi> was not an <hi>inviſible,</hi> but a <hi>viſible</hi> Recidivation; For this muſt in reaſon be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a viſible and interpretative <hi>Apoſtacy, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, and falling off from his Profeſſion,</hi> declared by his <hi>wilful omiſſion,</hi> which by Promiſe and Vow he had engaged himſelf to perform. And what ſenſe the Divine Author, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> had of this ſin, is eaſie to be gathered from this tenth Chapter.</p>
               <p>The Holy Author directs his Epiſtle to a Society of Believers by <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> externally united and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102499:77"/>ſanctified to be viſible Members of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, that had not power to diſcern <hi>ſpirits</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi> but judge they might of Externals, <hi>words</hi> or <hi>actions.</hi> He wrote therefore to them, <hi>v.</hi> 23, 24, 25. to take care of their <hi>Carriage</hi> and <hi>Converſation</hi> that was ſenſibly to be diſcerned in their Religious Aſſemblies. That they did not decline or forſake <hi>Aſſembling;</hi> nor in thoſe Aſſemblies, <hi>profeſſion of Faith,</hi> nor <hi>mutual Exhortation,</hi> nor <hi>provocation to good Works:</hi> For the <hi>Blood of the Covenant</hi> by theſe wilful Omiſſions, would be accounted an <hi>unholy thing,</hi> and ſo was <hi>doing deſpight to the Spirit of Grace;</hi> and ſo throw away the probable means to get the helpful aſſiſtance of the <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> which was ready to attend upon them that were frequently buſied in thoſe holy Miniſtrations. For the <hi>Blood of the Covenant</hi> did ſanctifie them, as a viſible Society of the <hi>Faithful,</hi> to Religious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, which if they fell away from, they ſinned <hi>wilfully,</hi> and muſt look for a ſubſequent puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And now, I humbly beg of my well-meaning Country-men, that <hi>ſeparate</hi> and <hi>withdraw</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from us, that they would conſiderately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe things with the ſame ſpirit that I have written them, without gall of bitterneſs, or deſire of Revenge, and with meekneſs and holy fear. Be not wiſe in your own eyes; think ſoberly of your ſelves, and your waies: <hi>Be not high-minded but fear.</hi> Be not without fear, to <hi>add ſin unto ſin;</hi> weigh not things with a <hi>falſe Ballance;</hi> put not <hi>light for darkneſs,</hi> nor <hi>darkneſs for light, good for evil, &amp;c.</hi> This will bring woe and abomination,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:102499:78"/>This the way, while you clamour againſt others <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,</hi> to be guilty of the ſame you condemn, while wilfully you ſtand upon your miſtaken Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion.</p>
               <p>I know not how far you may flatter your ſelves with the Opinion you have aſſumed to your ſelves, and gained from others of your <hi>Sanctity;</hi> yet upon right deliberation, you muſt conclude with me, <hi>While you wilfully omit, or refuſe, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the Preceptive Rules of Piety preſcribed, you are guilty of tranſgreſſing the greateſt and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Commandement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, if thou beeſt involved in thoſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that uſually attend and aggravate theſe ſins; if thou ſinneſt yet <hi>openly, voluntarily, perfidiouſly,</hi> and <hi>impenitently,</hi> thou wilt render thy ſelf guilty of a moſt notorious Crime; and, without <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> and <hi>amendment,</hi> thou wilt haſten thy own miſery, and contributeſt, to thy power, to bring ſpeedy and inevitable ruine, upon the moſt flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> in the World.

               <p>IT is a great part of wiſdom, to ponder the way of our feet: And now, becauſe conſidering the iſſue and end of our <hi>Actions</hi> will keep us from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amiſs, give me leave mildly to repreſent, upon an impartial ſurvey, the dreadful conſequences of this ſin, thoſe curſed effects it certainly brings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Orders of men throughout the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The injury it offers to <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> and all thy Governours both <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical;</hi> while thou declareſt manifeſtly, thou ſuſpecteſt their <hi>goodneſs,</hi> doubteſt of their <hi>wiſdom,</hi> deſpiſeſt their <hi>Authority,</hi> and to thy utmoſt (by thy wilful <hi>Recuſancy</hi>) intimateſt to others, <hi>That they have raſhly, and inconſiderately, impoſed Commands that are unlawful and unwarrantable;</hi> and by this evil Example, miſguideſt thy Neighbour into a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Diſobedience. For when other ſins of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> reach to the injury of a perſon, or Family or two, this ſin of <hi>wilful Omiſſion</hi> is extenſively hurtful to all ſorts of Men in the Society, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbs the publick <hi>peace</hi> of all that are among us.</p>
               <p>Theſe <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> are dreadful and deteſtable, not only becauſe, making <hi>Diviſions,</hi> they certainly turn

               <p>It is no pleaſure to me to ſee, what I heartily bewail, the deplorable eſtate we are in at this time, in this poor diſtracted Nation, by that <hi>wilful Recuſancy</hi> and <hi>ſinful Separation,</hi> that by our tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and connivance, we have ſuffered unhappily to thrive and ſpread among us. When every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and party that hath deſerted the Communion of our Church, covers the deformity of this Errour with a Cloak of pretended <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and proudly and unyieldingly idolizeth his miſtaken <hi>Judgment,</hi> and limits his affection to his own Party of the ſame <hi>Perſwaſion,</hi> and betrays his diſaffections to thoſe of <hi>ſound Judgments,</hi> by venting his <hi>oppoſition</hi> wrathfully, with bitter In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives againſt them.</p>

               <p>Diverſity of miſled <hi>Judgments,</hi> and pretended <hi>Conſciences,</hi> have cauſed an alienation of <hi>Affections,</hi> and hence <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>bitterneſs</hi> hath broke out into

               </p>
               <p>The religious <hi>Ruler,</hi> and faithful <hi>Miniſter,</hi> muſt needs be grieved and diſquieted to ſee our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Profeſſion ſo much blaſphemed, the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and its <hi>Faith,</hi> ſo much diſgraced and deſpiſed, and the Name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Cauſe</hi> ſo much diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured.</p>

               <p>From this, as from a Fountain, hath that deluge of <hi>Sins</hi> flowed forth, that hath overſpread, and overwhelmed this unhappy Nation.</p>
               <p>We cannot deny but that almoſt every where we diſcover <hi>ſinful prejudices, ſuperſtition, blindneſs of heart, Raſh judging</hi> and <hi>cenſuring</hi> both of holy Perſons and ſound Doctrines; <hi>Pride, vain-glory</hi> and <hi>hypocriſie; Envy, hatred, malice</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs.</hi>

               <p>Neither hath this deteſtable ſin made us thus miſerable among our ſelves, but hath rendred us unhappy among <hi>other Nations;</hi> when it hath brought a diſ-repute of us, and a diſ-eſteem of our <hi>Religion,</hi> almoſt in all parts of the World.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> very well know, they can never ſet up their own Church, till they have pulled down ours, which alone ſtand in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for <hi>precedence,</hi> and outvies them. And to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy

Their fair <hi>ſpeeches</hi> and ſmooth <hi>actions</hi> in this caſe could not acquit but condemn them, whilſt both of them were uſed with this end by them, to deceive the hearts of the ſimple, and pervert their practice from the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niform Communion of a Believing Society.</p>
               <p>It is ſad, but true, that ſuch from Believers <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> (if they will be directed by the Apoſtle, and perſwaded) muſt loſe the reputation of being <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and be marked and noted for ſuch as are not <hi>ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And further, if it be queſtioned, Whether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing wilfully in a manifeſt ſin be inconſiſtent with the <hi>ſtate of Grace,</hi> or not? certainly, upon ſerious Inquiry, it muſt be determined <hi>Affirmatively.</hi> And it muſt be granted, upon the Reaſons fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, That <hi>wilful Omiſſion</hi> of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Duties of <hi>Piety</hi> is an open ſin, and ſuch a ſin as withdraw men from the kindly operations of <hi>Grace,</hi> and makes God withhold and turn away his <hi>Spirit</hi> from a People, who waits to be gracious to his Servants, uſually, while in the exerciſe of <hi>Holineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:102499:82"/>
               <p>This deſpiſing of <hi>Holy Duties,</hi> puts a contempt, and offers deſpite to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Grace:</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, the conſequence of that ſin is ſad enough, that makes God withhold his <hi>Spirit</hi> from men, ſuch <hi>draw back to perdition</hi> by their viſible Recidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>The effects and conſequences of this ſin, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, will be dreadful (as you have heard) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Men;</hi> and there will be a ſad iſſue of this ſin from the <hi>Juſt GOD,</hi> who not only will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his <hi>Grace,</hi> but will manifeſt his diſpleaſure by his <hi>wrath</hi> which will come upon the <hi>wilful Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Diſobedience.</hi> And good it will be for this ſinner in time to conſider, That although he may poſſibly eſcape the condemning Judgment of <hi>falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Man,</hi> yet he cannot warrantably promiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to eſcape in another day the condemnation of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Sins of <hi>Omiſſion,</hi> that are obſtinately for the moſt part perſiſted in, will fare worſe than ſins of <hi>Commiſſion</hi> that oftimes are repented of, and will meet with a more ſevere Sentence from the mouth of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And the mind of Chriſt is clearly diſcovered unto us in this particular, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.41. when as accurſed, they ſhall hear that fearful <hi>Diſcedite, Depart ye into everlaſting fire prepared for the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</hi> And the ſin he chargeth them with, and ſentenceth them for, was a <hi>wilful omiſſion</hi> of Acts of <hi>Charity. For I was an hungry, and ye gave me no meat; Thirſty, and ye gave me no drink; Naked, and ye cloathed me not, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, if for <hi>wilful Omiſſion</hi> of ſuch Acts of <hi>Charity,</hi> ſinners ſhall hear that fearful <hi>Ite maledicti,</hi>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:102499:82"/>how juſtly may they hear the like dreadful Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for omiſſion of Acts of <hi>Piety: You have not worſhipped mein the beauty of Holineſs; You have not ſpoken to my Praiſe, to make my Name glorious; You have not held faſt the open profeſſion of your Faith, &amp;c.</hi> For greater ſins, there cannot reaſonably be expected a leſſer Sentence, or eaſier puniſhment, from the moſt juſt Judge.</p>
               <p>For ſinning thus wilfully, what can be looked for but <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>fiery Indignation. If he that deſpiſed the publick Law</hi> and polity <hi>of</hi> Moſes <hi>was judged worthy of Death, of how much ſorer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall he be thought worthy,</hi> that <hi>wilfully</hi> deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thoſe Rules that are commanded by the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt.

               </p>
               <p>And now my dear Country-men, that have been too long Diſſenters, who have ſtood at diſtance, and <hi>ſeparated</hi> from us, I humbly beſeech you in the Name of the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> that you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, That by your <hi>Baptiſme</hi> you have been dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the <hi>Obedience</hi> of the <hi>Faith</hi> of which you have made profeſſion.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Tranſgreſſor</hi> we mean, is the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſant</hi> who wilfully omits to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to thoſe <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Forms</hi> preſcribed and ordered in our <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,</hi> which are agreeable to the Rules of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> And this <hi>wilful Omiſſion</hi> in every <hi>Baptized</hi> Subject, how ſlight of trivial ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:102499:84"/>it may ſeem to be, I ſoberly and deliberately affirm and maintain to be a worſe ſin than <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Theft, Adultery,</hi> or any other ſingle ſin of Commiſſion; whereby the prohibitive Rule of <hi>Charity</hi> is tranſgreſſed, which is to be deteſted and avoided by every Believing perſon, who would live comfortably in any Believing Society.</p>
            <p>For it being a <hi>Tranſgreſſion</hi> of the firſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and moſt comprehenſive Law of <hi>Piety,</hi> it muſt be a greater ſin than that which <hi>tranſgreſſeth</hi> a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular prohibitive Law that concerns <hi>Charity;</hi> that ſin being a <hi>wilful averſion</hi> from that way that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly leads to that full content and happineſs, which ought to be intended. And this we cannot but adviſedly conclude, when this ſin, for the moſt part, as we may ſenſibly perceive, is attended with thoſe circumſtances, which muſt aggravate the Crime exceedingly.</p>
            <p>For when we obſerve ſuch <hi>Tranſgreſſors</hi> run into this ſin, not inconſiderately through <hi>ſurprizal,</hi> but deliberately and electively; not modeſtly, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently; not uncertainly or contingently, but conſtantly and obſtinately; when they ſtrive to be guilty of theſe Abominations, contrary to <hi>Vows</hi> and <hi>Reſolutions;</hi> and when we confider the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſequences, what can we do leſs than without raſhneſs conclude, That ſuch are <hi>heinous Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsors,</hi> and <hi>dangerouſly Diſobedient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when ſuch <hi>Tranſgreſſors</hi> are very rarely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted or amended by <hi>monitions</hi> or <hi>perſwaſions,</hi> it is but reaſonable and neceſſary that Religious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours (if it can be) ſhould reſtrain them by the threatning and predetermination of <hi>Puniſhments.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="160" facs="tcp:102499:85"/>
            <p>For when <hi>Governours</hi> are to be ſet over Societies, to promote their publick good and happineſs, it is juſt and reaſonable, not only by propoſing <hi>Rewards</hi> they ſhould encourage their People to Religious and Vertuous Duties, which will render them happy and comfortable, but alſo by threatning and predetermining of <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> to reſtrain and deter them from evil and enormous Actions, which will render their lives wretched and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>They miſtake dangerouſly, and wander no little out of the way, who make it their work to defame the <hi>threatning</hi> and <hi>determining</hi> of Puniſhments with the odious ſlander of <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Bitterneſs,</hi> when theſe things are evidences of the Rulers <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Care,</hi> who are ſet over a People by God to be a Terrour, and affright the People from doing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil by ſuch manifeſt Determinations.</p>
            <p>If Perſons were ſo well diſpoſed, that they would be perſwaded to be good by <hi>Counſels</hi> or <hi>Monitions,</hi> or vvould be ſo ingenious as to be drawn to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and Vertuous Actions by propoſal of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> then my mercy is ſuch, as I would have <hi>threatning</hi> and <hi>determination</hi> of <hi>Puniſhments</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born.</p>
            <p>But, when we ſee Men are led by <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Cuſtome</hi> more than <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and are generally vain in their Imaginations, diſorderly in their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wild and precipitantly irregular in their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, it is needful to limit and circumſcribe this their beaſtly <hi>Exorbitancy</hi> with an Hedge of Thorns, and to bound them with a Fence of <hi>Puniſhments.</hi> When <hi>fooliſhneſs</hi> is bound up in moſt mens childiſh
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:102499:85"/>hearts, that incline them to <hi>extravagancy,</hi> it is but the fatherly love and care of good <hi>Rulers,</hi> by the Rod of <hi>Correction,</hi> to drive it away. Thus are they truly repreſented to be <hi>Patres patriae,</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> cannot be blamed for harſhneſs, if they carry themſelves towards their <hi>Subjects,</hi> with the ſame tenderneſs that the beſt <hi>Fathers</hi> carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves towards their <hi>Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot reaſonably be accounted a ſign of an unnatural <hi>Cruelty,</hi> but an indication of a diſcreet <hi>Mercy,</hi> for a Father to threaten and ſhake the Rod over his Child; when he does not this with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to <hi>vex</hi> and <hi>torture</hi> him, but with an intent to reſtrain him from <hi>inconſiderateneſs</hi> and <hi>vanity</hi> that will diſtract him, and to move him to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, to receive that <hi>inſtruction</hi> which he deſires ſhould be inſtilled into him.</p>
            <p>And thus it is with the good Rulers in their threatning of <hi>Bonds, Stripes</hi> or <hi>Death,</hi> upon ſuch or ſuch Tranſgreſſions. It cannot be thought, their deſign in this is to <hi>torment</hi> and <hi>ruine</hi> their Subjects, but only by ſetting the inconveniencies and grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that attend <hi>exorbitancies</hi> before their eyes, they would ſtop them, and divert them from irregular courſes, and move and quicken them to the care of conformity to their <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Directions,</hi> which will certainly felicitate them.</p>
            <p>And in all this, They are but Gods <hi>Deputies,</hi> and ſhew themſelves like him whom they ought to repreſent, who uſed this method to his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple when he gave the Law at <hi>Sinah,</hi> when there was <hi>thundrings and lightnings, noiſe of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and the Mountain ſmoaking;</hi> theſe all to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:102499:86"/>work in the People an <hi>holy fear,</hi> which is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of wiſdom, to depart from evil that they ſin not, and to quicken them to obſerve his holy Commandements.</p>
            <p>And ſure we cannot in reaſon think, that either God, or the Ruler, deſigns <hi>vexation</hi> or <hi>deſtruction</hi> when they threaten them. It is natural to them to ſhew <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Compaſſion.</hi> They are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined <hi>to afflict willingly, nor to greive the Sons of men.</hi> They are loath to <hi>torment</hi> or <hi>deſtroy,</hi> who would have all men come to the practice of <hi>Truth</hi> and be ſaved.</p>
            <p>He never can be imagined in reaſon, to intend <hi>wounding</hi> or <hi>deſtruction,</hi> who gives warning before hand of the blow; by that the Creature prepares it ſelf (if it hath either <hi>ſenſe</hi> or <hi>reaſon</hi>) to guard it, or eſcape it. The threatning of <hi>Miſery, Death,</hi> or <hi>Hell,</hi> is a Mercy, without which we were like ſecurely to run upon them.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Miſeries</hi> were abſolutely decreed or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, that were <hi>Cruelty</hi> indeed; but when threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned conditionally, that is a <hi>Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it is evident, <hi>Deſtruction is of thy ſelf.</hi> Charge not unjuſtly and injuriouſly that as a fault, upon <hi>God</hi> or thy <hi>Rulers,</hi> which by thy own guilt thou pulleſt upon thy own head.</p>
            <p>They threatned it upon condition of thy <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion</hi> and <hi>Diſobedience,</hi> ſo 'tis thy <hi>wilful Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying</hi> that gives thee up voluntary to the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thou art contented to torment thy ſelf. Thou ſaweſt the danger, and wouldſt run into it. Thou kneweſt the puniſhment, and wouldſt pull it upon thy own head. Thou conſpiredſt againſt thy
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:102499:86"/>own peace and ſafety. That thou periſheſt, it is thy own choice; for chuſing the <hi>Sin,</hi> thou didſt chuſe the <hi>Puniſhment.</hi> Thy Blood lies upon thy ſelf. Thou periſheſt without others fault, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt thy ſelf without excuſe.</p>
            <p>Thus it is evident, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nnatural Cruelty</hi> is falſly and injuriouſly charged upon <hi>God</hi> or the <hi>Rulers,</hi> for threatning or determining <hi>Puniſhments;</hi> when the Offender only is Cruel to himſelf, who <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily</hi> (though he hath warning) runs upon them.</p>
            <p>Again, Rulers, which are <hi>Gods</hi> on Earth, ſhew themſelves moſt Rational, when they ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt to reſemble God, by manifeſting thoſe Divine excellencies to be conſpicuouſly in them, which render God glorious in his Providence throughout the World. And this manifeſtation they moſt clearly give, when they deliberately determine <hi>Puniſhments</hi> before-hand, to be inflicted upon open Tranſgreſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Thus they manifeſt <hi>Wiſdom:</hi> For if determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of <hi>Puniſhments</hi> were ſudden upon a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a ſenſible Injury, they might be ſuſpected and deemed the irruptions of a diſorderly <hi>Paſſion;</hi> but when fixed before hand, they cannot but be judged the reſult and product of ſober <hi>Reaſon.</hi> And that is <hi>wiſdom</hi> or <hi>prudence,</hi> which ordereth and diſpoſeth fit and ſuitable means to a right end.</p>
            <p>Now the right <hi>end</hi> and <hi>mark</hi> that Governours are to intend, is to promote the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>prevent all evil</hi> from the Society. Now the means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent <hi>evil,</hi> is to divert People from Actions that are
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:102499:87"/>
               <hi>irregular</hi> and <hi>vitious,</hi> which are the cauſe of all <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries</hi> that happen on a Nation.</p>
            <p>Now no ſuch hindrance or reſtraint can be put upon People from <hi>evil actions,</hi> as to put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the thoughts and conſiderations of thoſe <hi>miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> and <hi>inconveniences</hi> that will ſucceed. And this is moſt probably done by the publication of thoſe determined <hi>Judgments</hi> and <hi>Inconveniences</hi> that muſt inevitably follow upon <hi>Irregularities.</hi> Theſe are moſt likely to prove the moſt effectual means, to keep <hi>rational Creatures</hi> from running into them.</p>
            <p>For, <hi>Malum quá malum, non eſt eligendum;</hi> No man chooſeth what is abſolutely Evil, either <hi>ſin</hi> or <hi>greivance.</hi> No man will perſiſt obſtinately in that way, that in the end, if he turns not from it, he ſees will <hi>ruine</hi> him undoubtedly.</p>
            <p>Evil of <hi>Miſery</hi> before a mans face (unleſs he be mad) will make a man turn from evil of <hi>Iniquity;</hi> ſo the publication of the Magiſtrates certain deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Miſeries,</hi> unavoidably to happen upon wilful Tranſgreſſors, is the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the Rulers <hi>Prudence,</hi> being the moſt probable means to keep their Subjects from <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſecond</hi> thing wherein the good Rulers are to manifeſt their likeneſs to God, would be <hi>Purity,</hi> and <hi>abhorrence of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, how can this <hi>Purity</hi> be manifeſt in God or his Rulers more clearly, than by executing <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> upon Tranſgreſſors; by ordaining Arrows againſt ſuch <hi>Perſecutors,</hi> and preparing for them,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:102499:87"/>according to their Merits, the <hi>inſtruments of death</hi> How can this be made known better, than by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the dreadful effects of their wrath to come upon the <hi>wilful children of Diſobedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Should they be ſilent, and not manifeſt their <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure</hi> thus againſt <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> the <hi>ſecure Sinners</hi> would be ready to think that <hi>they were altogether ſuch as themſelves;</hi> but determining to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon the <hi>

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>third</hi> thing that in reaſon Rulers are to diſcover their reſemblance to God in, is, <hi>loving Righteouſneſs,</hi> and this is beſt done by being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to do the thing which is right, to give a <hi>meet Recompence,</hi> rendring what is due, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding every man according to his works.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Juſtice</hi> is not an idle, lazy, unactive <hi>Vertue,</hi> as if Rulers might ſatisfie themſelves with barren <hi>notions,</hi> and curious, but unfruitful <hi>ſpeculations.</hi> But ſhe is operative and practical, and where ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is buſie not only in paſſing a <hi>right Sentence,</hi> but due <hi>execution of Recompence;</hi> and that not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>quality</hi> of the Perſon, but the <hi>merit</hi> of the Work. Not only acquitting the <hi>Innocent,</hi> but condemning the <hi>Guilty;</hi> not only defending and rewarding the <hi>Righteous,</hi> but alſo puniſhing the <hi>wilful Sinner,</hi> and pouring out <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> upon the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteous,</hi> giving them that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe which is meet.</p>
            <p>And therefore we ſee not only <hi>Scepters,</hi> and <hi>Purſes,</hi> and <hi>Crowns,</hi> as Emblems of the <hi>Judges</hi>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:102499:88"/>Honour, but alſo <hi>Rods,</hi> and <hi>Swords,</hi> and <hi>Axes,</hi> to ſignifie the deſign of their Office to be as well a <hi>terrour and avenger of them that do Ill,</hi> as a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancer and rewarder of them that do Well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Sword</hi> is not to be born in vain, but to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the Rulers intention to <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> He ought to diſcover it by his threatning and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of <hi>Puniſhments</hi> againſt wilful Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The religious Ruler is to ſhew himſelf like God in <hi>exactineſs of Juſtice,</hi> and to evidence himſelf <hi>no reſpecter of Perſons,</hi> and to do all things without <hi>partiality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is beſt, when in a Land, like the <hi>Sun</hi> in the Firmament, it ſhineth with equal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the <hi>thatched Cottage,</hi> as on the <hi>Ivory Palace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſhews all the ſame, countenance, weighs all things with an equal balance. <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Dirt, Pibbles</hi> and <hi>Diamonds,</hi> according to their weight turn her Beam. <hi>Diverſe weights and meaſures</hi> the accounts an <hi>abomination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gods <hi>Deputies</hi> are to incline to <hi>exact Judgment,</hi> and to ſhew themſelves ready to puniſh the <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>mighty,</hi> as ſoon as the <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>contemptible.</hi> And this is beſt done by Governours fixing and predetermining of <hi>Puniſhments</hi> upon the Offence, without reſpect to the <hi>quality</hi> or <hi>relation</hi> of the Offender.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Impartiality</hi> and <hi>Juſtice, Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> theſe Divine graces, are beſt diſcovered in Gods <hi>Deputies,</hi> which, unqueſtionably, is the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102499:88"/>moſt reaſonable thing in the World.</p>
            <p>One thing remains yet to be proved, which is aſſerted in this Propoſition, <hi>That threatning and determining of Puniſhments, by Rulers, upon ſuch wilful Tranſgreſs;orts, is according to the conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, if we conſult the prophane <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of all Ages and Nations, we ſhall find, never any Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple joyned in Society of any Religion, <hi>true</hi> or <hi>falſe,</hi> but had their determinations of <hi>Puniſhments</hi> upon thoſe that were openly <hi>diſobedient,</hi> upon thoſe who wilfully <hi>neglected</hi> and <hi>contemned</hi> ſuch Services and Duties enjoyned, that they judged expedient and neceſſary to procure the favour and bleſſing of that <hi>Deity</hi> which they agreed to adore. And this is ſo evident, as is confeſſed of all, and needs no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof or illuſtration.</p>
            <p>But if we will conſult <hi>Sacred Writ,</hi> which may content us, we cannot but obſerve, that GOD himſelf can rarely be found to have taken care of the Conduct of any perſons, or People, to direct them in the exerciſe of an <hi>acceptable Religion,</hi> but he fenced up their way with Thorns, to limit their <hi>aberration,</hi> and reſtrain them from <hi>ſin,</hi> with a Commination of <hi>Penalties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, that our Firſt Parents might fear to eat of the <hi>forbidden Fruit,</hi> he threatens them with <hi>Death,</hi> as a certain effect and conſequence of their <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus to <hi>Cain, If thou doſt not well, Sin lies at the door.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, to move <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed to keep his Covenant of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> God threatens,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:102499:89"/>Gen. 17.14. <hi>That the uncircumciſed Man-child, whoſe fleſh of his Fore-skin was uncircumciſed, that Soul ſhould be cut off from his People; for he hath broken my Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus in that <hi>Theocracy</hi> over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> every where we read <hi>Curſes</hi> denounced upon <hi>Diſobedience;</hi> And by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and all the Prophets, he threatens <hi>to viſit their ſins with Rods, and their offences with Scourges.</hi> So Levit. 26.14, &amp;c. <hi>If you will not hearken to me, and will not do all theſe Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. If you ſhall deſpiſe my Statutes, I will ſet my face againſt you for evil, &amp;c. ſaith the LORD; And, if you will walk contrary unto me, and not hearken, I will bring ſeven times more Plagues upon you, according to your ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And certainly, it cannot be bad or unreaſonable for <hi>Rulers</hi> to uſe the ſame method in governing their Subjects, that <hi>GOD</hi> uſed in ruling his own People, <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we conſult the method <hi>Chriſt</hi> uſed to govern his Church in this laſt Diſpenſation, it is impoſſible but we muſt acknowledge, <hi>That a coercive Power, by Commination of Judgments, to</hi> reſtrain from evil, <hi>and</hi> quicken to good, <hi>cannot be unlawful for the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, when it was practiced by</hi> Chriſt <hi>himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> that Meſſenger ſent by Chriſt, <hi>before his face to prepare his waies,</hi> preſſeth upon his Auditors the Goſpel duty of <hi>Repentance,</hi> and this he inforceth from this reaſon, <hi>becauſe the kingdom of Heaven was at hand.</hi> Which is not to be underſtood of <hi>Mercies</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> only, that were promiſed, that might attract and encourage
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:102499:89"/>them to <hi>Goſpel Duties;</hi> but of <hi>Judgments</hi> and <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments</hi> threatned to be executed, which might inforce them to receive and obey the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> And there, <hi>Matt.</hi> 3. this Holy Preacher tells them, <hi>The Axe was laid to the Roots of the Tree. Fire</hi> and <hi>Wrath</hi> was coming upon the <hi>unbelieving World,</hi> which could not be eſcaped but by <hi>Repentance,</hi> and bringing forth fruits worthy of <hi>Amendment of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf preacheth the ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and urgeth the neceſſity of it from the ſame Motive; <hi>For, except they Repented, they ſhould all likewiſe periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when Chriſt had cured the <hi>Impotent man,</hi> to make him every whit whole, and to reſtrain him from ſin, he affrights him with a Commination of a <hi>worſe thing coming unto him.</hi> And to quicken his Diſciples, to <hi>work the works they were ſent about while it was day,</hi> he minds them of a <hi>night coming when no man ſhould work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, to awaken his Country-men at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to <hi>know and conſider the time of their Viſitation,</hi> and to <hi>mind the things that concern their Peace,</hi> he tells them of a time when <hi>Peace ſhould be hid from their eyes,</hi> and <hi>their Houſes ſhould be left to them deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus did the Apoſtles, in the Primitive times, who knew the mind, and had the Spirit of Chriſt; they threatned the <hi>Impenitent</hi> with a <hi>day of wrath,</hi> a <hi>day of vengeance,</hi> a <hi>day of puniſhing thoſe with everlaſting deſtruction that knew not God, and obeyed not the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="170" facs="tcp:102499:90"/>
            <p>So the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to deter and terrifie thoſe Baptized perſons from <hi>Separation,</hi> and <hi>forſaking holy Aſſembling,</hi> not to decline mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>exhortation</hi> and <hi>profeſſion of Faith,</hi> he tells them of a <hi>day of Judgment,</hi> a <hi>day of Vengeanee</hi> was ſuddenly approaching.</p>
            <p>And this courſe was uſed by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in the Primitive times, at the planting of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> by threatning of <hi>Judgments</hi> and <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi> to drive their Followers to <hi>Repentance.</hi> Certainly, upon ſober conſideration, it cannot be lookt upon as unwarrantable, if pious Governours affright from evil thoſe Subjects that elſe would be <hi>diſobedient,</hi> with menacing and determining <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments</hi> to be inflicted upon them.</p>
            <p>Thoſe frivolous Objections we meet with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Truth are not worth the mentioning, and, if throughly perpended, we may conclude them the iſſue of <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>paſſion</hi> of men bent to <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> and not the words of ſober Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>And what Spirit they are led with, let any ſober man judge, who reproach and defame the juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of <hi>emendatory Puniſhments</hi> upon <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſancy,</hi> and <hi>wilful omiſſion</hi> of neceſſary Duties (which is an open ſin) with the odious name of PERSECUTION; and are ready to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the Rulers and Officers if they threaten theſe Penalties (much more if they execute them) as <hi>Cruel, Tyrannous</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs willingly, men that have not quite obliterated the Divine Image, have <hi>bowels of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:102499:90"/>Mercy,</hi> are full of <hi>Pity</hi> and <hi>Compaſſion,</hi> and <hi>Pugnat cum Natura hominis, Dolore quâ Dolor ſatiari;</hi> for any man to be full of <hi>Malice,</hi> and to contrive with malicious intention to <hi>torment</hi> and endeavour to <hi>deſtroy</hi> his Neighbour, is unnatural and unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, it is a ſin.</p>
            <p>But thus, unreaſonably and falſly, have they done what they can to blaſt the Repute of an harmleſs and neceſſary Duty with a bad Name, when <hi>Puniſhments</hi> are threatned by the pious Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, with the deſign of Peoples <hi>amendment</hi> and <hi>ſafety,</hi> not their <hi>torment</hi> or <hi>deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No man intends his Beaſts ſhould run into the Ditch, or hedge of Thorns, wherewith he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſeth his Grounds; but deſigns only they may feed ſafely within due Bounds. It is peeviſh and ill-natur'd for them to clamour of <hi>Perſecution,</hi> when their <hi>Extravagances</hi> are limited, and <hi>ſafety</hi> endeavoured. But ſo it is, ſome froward Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, when any waies conſtrained to be <hi>vertuous,</hi> and reſtrained from being <hi>vicious,</hi> will cry out they are <hi>perſecuted</hi> and <hi>afflicted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, if any <hi>Affliction</hi> or <hi>Puniſhment</hi> does follow the wilful Tranſgreſſion of theſe men, it is not the Magiſtrates deſigning or cauſing; but their own chuſing is juſtly blamed, who pull <hi>Tribulation</hi> upon themſelves by the errours of their own waies.</p>
            <p>Again, when Rulers and Officers, by agreeing and fixing of <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> conſtrain men, through objected Inconveniences, to reflect upon the evil of their waies and return from them, and to come into the way of Truth, who otherwiſe would ſtill erre and be deceived; it is <hi>Mercy</hi> of the Ruler to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:102499:91"/>the Tranſgreſſour, who deſigns his <hi>ſalvation.</hi> The <hi>Cruelty</hi> (if any) is to the <hi>Sin,</hi> and its no fault to deſign its deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Perſecution</hi> then is faulty and blame worthy when 'tis for <hi>well-doing</hi> only, when men are hated for <hi>Righteouſneſs ſake,</hi> without any cauſe when men are induſtriouſly purſued, to be vexed and tormented for walking in waies of <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs.</hi> This is <hi>Perſecution</hi> indeed to be complained of and lamented.</p>
            <p>But when <hi>Puniſhments</hi> are deliberately threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and inflicted upon open <hi>Diſobedience</hi> and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Recuſancy,</hi> theſe are Acts of <hi>remunerative Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> a Nations prop and and glory, and deſerve juſtly to be commended. It is injurious to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count this a <hi>Perſecution</hi> that deſerves to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>They are therefore deſervedly accounted <hi>mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> and <hi>injurious,</hi> who clamour againſt the juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of <hi>Puniſhments</hi> by pious Rulers againſt open Tranſgreſſions, with cenſures of a <hi>culpable Perſecution,</hi> which is, doing <hi>Juſtice</hi> and no <hi>Injury;</hi> is <hi>Mercy</hi> and no <hi>Cruelty;</hi> an evidence of the Rulers deſign of his Subjects <hi>Converſion</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> not of <hi>Vexation</hi> and <hi>Deſtruction.</hi> Which if it doth happen upon the <hi>obſtinate Offender,</hi> he pulls it upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his own choice; it comes not from the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> intention or reſolution.</p>
            <p>Another Objection we hear frequently againſt the threatning and determination of <hi>Puniſhments</hi> by Chriſtian Magiſtrates, it is openly complained, <hi>That they force the Conſcience of the Righteous, which ought to have its Liberty. Their Conſcience,</hi> they
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:102499:91"/>cry it abroad, <hi>ought to be left Free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I appeal to any ſober perſon to judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe Complaints of <hi>Greivances</hi> be not rather fancied and feigned, than poſſible to be feared or impoſed: But ſome there are that fear where no fear was.</p>
            <p>To diſcourſe this Point, in reference to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State, <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> threatned by our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours Laws, for <hi>wilful Recuſancy,</hi> is, twelve pence for one Sunday, twenty pound for one Month, to be levied by <hi>Diſtreſs,</hi> a Force is threatned upon their <hi>Purſe,</hi> and they cry out a Force is offered to their <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which is impoſſible.</p>
            <p>For when the Magiſtrates Sword and Power can reach only to <hi>Goods,</hi> or <hi>Body,</hi> or what is <hi>external</hi> (than this they can do no more) they can have no power of the concluſions of the Underſtanding, or reſolutions of the Will, or any thing <hi>internal,</hi> which we muſt underſtand by <hi>Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, ſuppoſe the Magiſtrate can have any power upon <hi>Conſcience,</hi> the operation he can have will prove but <hi>Moral,</hi> not <hi>Phyſical;</hi> to <hi>incline</hi> it, not to <hi>force</hi> it. Neither is this to be conceived feaſible by <hi>Man,</hi> which is hardly to be conceived to be done by <hi>God</hi> himſelf: For <hi>Force</hi> implies a thing to be done of thee, thou art meerly <hi>paſſive</hi> when Forced, and is ſcarcely to be imagined of volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Agents, who are <hi>active,</hi> and are ſaid to do what they do themſelves. <hi>Quicquid fit de te, tu non facis;</hi> Thy <hi>Concluſion</hi> or <hi>Reſolution,</hi> is thy own voluntary Act.</p>
            <p>And as I ſaid before of the <hi>Liberty,</hi> ſo I ſay now of <hi>Force,</hi> It is inconſiſtent with, and cannot be
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:102499:92"/>offered to <hi>Conſcience.</hi> Thy <hi>Conſcience</hi> is freely thine own, and cannot be forced, and if Force be upon any thing it is upon <hi>externals</hi> only, it cannot be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy <hi>Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou feareſt, and crieſt out of that which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be offered thee, namely, <hi>Force of Conſcience;</hi> and thou doteſt on and idolizeſt a <hi>Chimaera,</hi> NO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THING, what thou canſt never find, namely, <hi>Liberty of Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> thou coutendeſt for, as thou ſaiſt. Conſider, thou haſt not fully expreſt thy mind and intendment; thou canſt not deſire or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for what thou canſt not poſſibly have. There is ſomething elſe thou meaneſt and contendeſt for; and really, that thing is <hi>liberty of Action, licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Recuſancy,</hi> that thou maiſt freely tranſgreſs the Preceptive Laws of <hi>Piety</hi> without <hi>penalty.</hi> And this thou painteſt and gildeſt over with a varniſh and pretence of <hi>Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, what Rule haſt thou that directs thee <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> to omit and refuſe the <hi>Publick Exerciſes of Piety?</hi> And if no certain <hi>Rule,</hi> thou canſt have no <hi>ſound Conſcience.</hi> Thou haſt a Rule that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids <hi>Recuſancy,</hi> and it is a ſin; Wilt thou pretend a <hi>Conſcience,</hi> to continue in ſin? If thou haſt any Conſcience in what thou contendeſt for, it muſt be an <hi>accuſing</hi> or <hi>condemning</hi> one: And well it were if the Sword of the Magiſtrate could Force this <hi>Conſcience</hi> from thee.</p>
            <p>I am ſure thou deſireſt amiſs to have <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Freedom</hi> to enjoy a <hi>condemning Conſcience.</hi> I have no patience to perſiſt any further Arguing; but I have ſo much charity, not to deſiſt from
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:102499:92"/>praying for you, that our Father would forgive you, <hi>for you know not what you ſay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At laſt then, ſtudy to be quiet, you that <hi>diſſent</hi> and <hi>ſeparate</hi> from us, and ſeriouſly conſider how your heat of <hi>Oppoſition</hi> and <hi>Contention</hi> hath tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported you to the venting of ſuch ridiculous Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as certainly, if we do not abjure Reaſon, we muſt expect to ſee them ſuddenly hiſſed out of the Nation.</p>
            <p>From the Premiſes then, we muſt conclude, That the threatning and determining of <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> againſt <hi>Recuſancy,</hi> is <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Compaſſion,</hi> and ought not to be called <hi>Cruelty</hi> or <hi>Perſecution.</hi> That they tend to the <hi>informing</hi> and not <hi>inforcing</hi> of Right <hi>Conſciences.</hi> And that 'tis clearly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, from <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and her Dictates; from the <hi>Cuſtome</hi> of all Nations; from the practice of <hi>GOD,</hi> both before, and in the time of the Law; from the preaching of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> in the time of the Goſpel; they are not only <hi>juſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> but <hi>expedient</hi> and neceſſary in the Church of GOD.</p>

            <p>Now, refined <hi>Notions,</hi> and empty <hi>Speculations,</hi> are not ſufficient for the diſcharge of the Rulers duty in diſtributive <hi>Righteouſneſs:</hi> But his buſineſs is done in his office by <hi>practice</hi> and <hi>action,</hi> and his care muſt be not only of paſſing a right Sentence, but of <hi>impartial</hi> execution of a meet Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, proportioned to the Merit of every mans work.</p>
            <p>Not only, that they who obey honeſt Laws, and continue in <hi>well-doing,</hi> may have <hi>Commands, Riches, Glory,</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Rewards,</hi> as encouragements to <hi>Vertuous actions;</hi> but alſo, that they who are wilfully diſobedient, may have <hi>Indignation, Wrath, Tribulation, Anguiſh</hi> and <hi>Penalties</hi> inflicted, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints and deterrments from <hi>ſinful</hi> and <hi>Irregular attempts.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="178" facs="tcp:102499:94"/>
            <p>And to ſee this latter done, is the Magiſtrates Province as much as the former, being ſent by God as much for the <hi>puniſhment of evil doers,</hi> as for the <hi>praiſe of them that do well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>REWARDS</hi> and <hi>P<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NISHMENTS</hi> are like two Pillars or Walls, that ſupport and uphold the ſtately ſtructure of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> under whoſe ſhadow and defence a People may abide and reſt comfortably, in peaceful Habitations. Take away one <hi>Pillar</hi> or <hi>Wall,</hi> and all is ſhuffled together, the whole building becomes uſeleſs, and is ruin'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
            <p>Let there be no fear of an <hi>enſuing Puniſhment</hi> to follow upon acts of <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> in our Nation, and there will be little love or care of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> in the midſt of us.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Puniſhment</hi> ſhould be inflicted upon the Offender is natural and divine. God in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning did determine it, and ſurely what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines is Juſt, in whom is no <hi>unrighteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if the threatning and determining of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments be <hi>Juſt,</hi> then it muſt follow, the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting</hi> of them muſt be <hi>Juſt</hi> alſo, and will follow certainly, <hi>For he that is righteous hateth lying, and he that loveth Truth, will faithfully perform what he hath deliberately promiſed; and what he hath ſpoken for his Honours ſake, will certainly bring it to paſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To act like God cannot be injuſt; therefore <hi>Gods Deputies</hi> in judging any part of the World, as to determine puniſhments upon Offenders, ſo to inflict them when determined, muſt be <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>reaſonable</hi> alſo.</p>
            <pb n="179" facs="tcp:102499:94"/>
            <p>Again, <hi>Rulers</hi> are to be like God, and their chief Duty, by his appointment that ſent them to the Office, both by the <hi>Goſpel</hi> as well as the <hi>Law,</hi> is to <hi>execute vengeance upon wilful Tranſgreſſours.</hi> The <hi>Sword</hi> was given them, not as an empty badge of Honour, for a ſhew, for faſhion, for ornament only, but for uſe, for employment, for terrour; <hi>For he is the Miniſter of God, a Revenger, to execute wrath upon him that doth evil,</hi> Rom. 13.4.</p>
            <p>The Private man that taketh the <hi>Sword</hi> raſhly, ſhall periſh by the Sword of the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> juſtly; and <hi>who ſheddeth mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed.</hi> And it is a great part of wiſdom for an holy King, <hi>to ſcatter the wicked, and to bring the Wheel over them,</hi> Prov. 20.26.</p>
            <p>And without any great pains, it may be proved to have been the will of God in all times, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both before the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> under the <hi>Law,</hi> and under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that Capital <hi>Puniſhments</hi> (if the heynonſneſs of the Crime deſerved it) might be juſtly inflicted.</p>
            <p>And if <hi>Capital</hi> and <hi>Sanguinary puniſhments</hi> can be proved lawful, becauſe in all Ages appointed and allowed by God; ſure <hi>Emendatory puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> cannot be denied but they may be inflicted, and their inflicting may eaſily be juſtified.</p>
            <p>True indeed, we ought not to mock at <hi>Calamity,</hi> or rejoyce when an <hi>Enemy</hi> falleth. <hi>Vengeance</hi> ought not to be the Godly mans choice, which is not the delight of God himſelf; and 'tis not agreeable with the nature of Man, to delight himſelf with the grief, and to make himſelf pleaſure with the torment of his Neighbour.</p>
            <pb n="180" facs="tcp:102499:95"/>
            <p>Yet it is reaſonable and juſt the <hi>Malefactour</hi> ſhould be puniſhed, and that <hi>tribulation and wrath ſhould come upon him that works unrighteouſneſs.</hi> And certainly they have as little <hi>Charity</hi> as <hi>Reaſon,</hi> who blaſpheme him as malicious or miſchievous that accuſeth or puniſheth the <hi>Rebellious</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> as to the Malefactors, prove but like bitter, unpleaſing potions, that work ſtrongly for ſucceeding health. And if <hi>Capital,</hi> their <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> are deſtroyed that their <hi>Souls</hi> may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To put a period to the Malefactors wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;

               </q> 
               <hi>That they who would not learn to be good, may at laſt be reſtrained and ceaſe to do evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That others may be affrighted. For,
<q>Poena ad unum, metus ad omnes.</q> That the whole Congregation may hear and fear, and that they may not dare to ſin ſo preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, or to commit any ſuch evil among them; <hi>For when a Scorner is ſmitten, the ſimple will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware,</hi> Prov. 19.25.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the Righteous may be preſerved, which cannot be but by <hi>Coertions</hi> and <hi>Reſtraints</hi> upon the Wicked; keeping them in fear of <hi>Puniſhment.</hi> When, <hi>Inter tot ſupplicia ſontium ſatis tuta In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentia, Innocence</hi> it ſelf is ſcarcely ſafe, and is
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:102499:95"/>never ſecure amidſt all the <hi>Puniſhments.</hi> And to ſuſpend <hi>Penalties</hi> is the ready way to make the <hi>Rulers</hi> undervalued and contemned; their <hi>Laws</hi> ſlighted and reproached; to cauſe the Offender to grow ſecure, impudent and not aſhamed; to make the heart of the Righteous <hi>faint,</hi> and the hands of the Wicked <hi>ſtrengthned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon theſe and ſome other Reaſons, ſome dare not deny all <hi>Penalties,</hi> but would have them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted only for the breach of <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Moral Laws,</hi> but not at all for breach of <hi>Poſitive</hi> or <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I would have all <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in this point conſider that they may be informed, How <hi>that cannot be unlawful, in probability, if done in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Men, which was ſo oft done and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed by God himſelf, in his dealings and actings, amidſt the Government of his Choſen people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it may very eaſily be made appear, upon a little obſervation, <hi>That where God hath moſt clearly manifeſted his Care to perſons or people, that there he required Obedience</hi> (not only to commands of things or actions intrinſecally in their own nature good, but alſo to commands of things or actions that in themſelves were indifferent) <hi>when once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned and publiſhed; in that he did not only take Vengeance on them that deſpiſed his Moral Precepts, but executed it moſt ſeverely on them that tranſgreſſed his Poſitive Commands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus he moſt ſeverely puniſhed our Firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents for eating the <hi>Forbidden fruit; Achan,</hi> for touching the <hi>unclean thing; Saul,</hi> for ſparing <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag,</hi> and ſaving the <hi>beſt</hi> of the Prey; the <hi>Prophet</hi>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:102499:96"/>for <hi>eating Bread</hi> in the other Prophets houſe; <hi>Lots</hi> Wife, for <hi>looking back.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly, upon good reaſon this was done; for when God will maintain his <hi>Prerogative,</hi> and be tender of his <hi>Honour,</hi> How could he hold him guiltleſs that would deſpiſe his Authority <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding?</hi> ſuſpect his Goodneſs or Wiſdom, or both <hi>Directing?</hi> and, who frowardly as diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with his <hi>wiſe diſpoſal,</hi> would betray his diſtruſt of the <hi>ſufficiency of the Almighty,</hi> and call in queſtion his <hi>direction;</hi> and wilfully ſhall gratifie their own <hi>Humor</hi> and <hi>Fancy,</hi> rather than dutifully ſubmit to the expreſs deſignation and appointment of the moſt <hi>wiſe God.</hi> For, <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia in iis, quae parva ſunt, exploratius probatur;</hi> Diſobedience to thoſe <hi>leaſt Commands</hi> is the greateſt Diſobedience, when we dare rebel for a trifle.</p>
            <p>And certainly, in ſubmitting to <hi>Commands</hi> that ſeem leaſt neceſſary, we give teſtimony of our greateſt obſervance, when we bring under our <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> to our <hi>Faith,</hi> in his wiſe <hi>Directions,</hi> and ſilence our diſputing with <hi>ready Obeying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when perſons ſhall obey God only in thoſe things they conceive <hi>Reaſonable,</hi> or think them <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,</hi> only when the nature of the thing requireth it, or their own Intereſt or Advantage is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Certainly, in ſuch <hi>Obedience</hi> it may ſafely be concluded, <hi>That ſuch Perſons offend rather than do what is acceptable, when things are done with greater reſpect to pleaſe themſelves, rather than out of Reverence to pleaſe their God. And theſe Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions which have been ſo great Offences againſt God, muſt needs be alſo when againſt his Deputies,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:102499:96"/>even</hi> the neglect and breach of Poſitive Laws; <hi>and</hi> Puniſhments <hi>proportionably determined, are juſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon thoſe that are thus unreaſonably diſobedient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this means perſons diſcover their diſtruſt of the <hi>Providence of God;</hi> who, if any where, is to be found <hi>ſtanding in the Congregations of Princes, and ſits and judgeth amongſt the Gods: And, by whom Kings reign, by him Princes decree Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this means the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Ruler is made vile and deſpicable, and his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued, and <hi>Directions</hi> as contemptible.</p>
            <p>By this means others are prompted by thy <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,</hi> to harbour low conceits of their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and to run with thee into the like diſorder and miſcarriage; and the iſſue muſt be, <hi>unyield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs, oppoſition, confuſion,</hi> and <hi>every evil work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, by this means the <hi>Morality</hi> of the <hi>fifth Commandement</hi> is quite deſtroyed, when men can ſatisfie themſelves with a formal (which is oft feigned) reſpect to the <hi>Perſons,</hi> and have no regard to the <hi>Commands</hi> of their Governours.</p>
            <p>When in truth, <hi>Submiſſion</hi> to <hi>Humane Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> as much as they are ſlighted, is the cleareſt evidence of thy <hi>ſubjection</hi> to <hi>Higher Powers;</hi> and thy <hi>Diſobedience</hi> is no ſlight trifling <hi>diſobedience. That Puniſhment ſhould be inflicted, as determined, upon ſuch wilful Offenders, is juſt and reaſonable, and undoubtedly according to the will of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now well I wot for theſe Poſitions, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for this laſt (which I will hereafter in ſpight of oppoſition, more fully and more clearly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, if either deſired, commanded, or provoked
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:102499:97"/>to it) I muſt undoubtedly expect and prepare for it, That Troops of <hi>Antinomians, Anabaptiſts, Presbyterians, Independants, Quakers,</hi> all the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines</hi> and <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> will with open mouth come roaring upon me, and charge me as a perſon of a fiery, cruel, perſecuting diſpoſition, that hath nothing of the Goſpel Temper, nor of the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But if they would thus go on to reproach and rail on me, and lay things to my charge of which I am not guilty of, God he knows, by thoſe Courſes they will never be able to acquit or purge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>For who doth not ſee, how <hi>Ambition, Oppoſition,</hi> or <hi>Intereſt</hi> hath byaſſed and perverted their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (if they can be ſaid to have any in theſe things they pretend) when having ſtoln into a <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Party</hi> (as they falſly think) conſiderable; and willing to ſet up both, out of <hi>ambition</hi> in themſelves, and <hi>oppoſition</hi> to Governours; they never boggle, without check or fear, at the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing the <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>honeſt Laws</hi> eſtabliſhed, and <hi>Rules</hi> preſcribed unto us, ſuggeſting falſly, by their words and practices, that they are unlawful; and when by their <hi>obſtinacy</hi> they have incurred the danger of the Cenſure of the <hi>Laws,</hi> and the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties</hi> affixed to them, then it muſt be their main concern under a colour of <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and falſe-term'd <hi>Moderation,</hi> to ſtrive for a lawleſs <hi>Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that they may ſin (when they cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Guilt</hi>) yet without <hi>Puniſhment.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="185" facs="tcp:102499:97"/>
            <p>And now, It is their great buſineſs openly to preach and declare, <hi>That the execution of Penalties determined, ought to be ſuſpended, if not reſcinded,</hi> and ſo endeavour to involve the whole Nation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly to run into an Univerſal <hi>Licentiouſneſs,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hope of <hi>Impunity.</hi> Things they can never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve fit to be granted, whatever they ſay.</p>
            <p>For if the <hi>Power</hi> and the <hi>Sword</hi> were put into their hands, when no Nation can be preſerved, nor <hi>Juſtice</hi> executed, without inflicting <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> upon wilful Tranſgreſſours; it is not to be imagined but they would quickly give a divorce to theſe <hi>wild Principles</hi> they ſeem to eſpouſe and maintain; <hi>Puniſhments</hi> would quickly be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and readily executed by them on <hi>Diſſenters</hi> and <hi>Diſobedient;</hi> and no doubt of it, we ſhould feel by too ſenſible experience, what we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly known, <hi>That they would be more cruel and bloody, than any that can be juſtly charged upon our Governours to be ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſay what they can, it is evident it is not a <hi>Toleration</hi> but <hi>Maſtery</hi> that theſe men aim at; for had they power, I dare ſay, their fiery zeal would again be diſcovered to advance the Intereſt of their <hi>Sect</hi> and <hi>Opinion,</hi> and ſo ſevere would their <hi>Determinations</hi> be, and execution of <hi>Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> upon <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> as no man diſſenting ſhould find <hi>Impunity:</hi> Which, God forbid.</p>
            <p>But now let us examine their Objections againſt our laſt mentioned Poſitions, and ſeriouſly obſerve their ſtrength and reaſonableneſs, if any to be found in them.</p>
            <pb n="186" facs="tcp:102499:98"/>
            <p>And they object thus unanimouſly, <hi>That Bodily, or External Puniſhments, cannot be ſhewn to have been ordered, to be determined and inflicted by any Rules of the Goſpel, nor proved that ever they were determined or executed by Chriſt or his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, eſpecially not upon Omiſſion, or difference of any in the open profeſſion of Faith, or publick exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And without haeſitancy, with as much earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but with more truth and reaſon, we utterly deny all theſe things, and doubt not but to any ſober Reaſon, we ſhall aſſert and prove the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contrary.</p>
            <p>It is confeſſed by all, and not denied by any that I have met with, That, before the laſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, <hi>Bodily</hi> and <hi>External Puniſhments</hi> might lawfully be agreed upon and inflicted, and ſo they were in every Polity and Government: that <hi>Sin</hi> might be reſtrained, and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> executed, to preſerve <hi>Peace,</hi> and promote the welfare of the Society.</p>
            <p>Before <hi>Chriſts</hi> Incarnation, this is owned to have been natural and univerſal, and according to the different heinouſneſs of Offenders Crimes, and their noxious influence; ſo by wiſe Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours there hath been ordered variety and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>Puniſhments.</hi> The higheſt whereof have been <hi>Capital, mortal,</hi> deſtructory of the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> which is all the Ruler can reach unto. And that thoſe have been lawfully inflicted before the <hi>Law,</hi> and in the <hi>Law,</hi> is acknowledged by our Adverſaries themſelves.</p>
            <pb n="187" facs="tcp:102499:98"/>
            <p>Now, if our Oppoſers cannot ſhew where this was repealed in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> I am ſure I can ſhew where it was eſtabliſhed; For Chriſt came not to <hi>diſſolve, or deſtroy the Law of Nature, but confirm and fulfil it,</hi> and it muſt continue in Polities, as lawful in the times of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as it was before, and in the time of the <hi>Law.</hi> And this Inference muſt follow, <hi>If Capital, and deſtructory Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may, certainly, thoſe that are Emendatory may be determined and inflicted by Governours, from the Rules of the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, that the open and obſtinate may periſh by the <hi>Sword</hi> of the Higher Powers, <hi>who beareth it not in vain,</hi> is ſo plain from Chriſts own words and the Apoſtles Letters, as it were miſpending of time to inſiſt in a further proof or demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Therefore, ſome of our Adverſaries are ſo modeſt, as to confeſs the <hi>Goſpel</hi> doth permit <hi>Capital Puniſhments</hi> to be inflicted by Magiſtrates, upon contumacious perſons, diſturbing publick <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Peace;</hi> but for things or actions that concern <hi>Piety</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> either for <hi>Omiſſion</hi> or <hi>Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> the Goſpel gives the Offender an <hi>Impunity</hi> and <hi>Indempnity,</hi> ſay our Oppoſers in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; but with what truth or reaſon let any man judge.</p>
            <p>But yet it is confidently aſſerted, <hi>That Hereſie, or any erronious Opinion (which man can give a Reputation unto with a ſpecious name of</hi> CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SCIENCE, <hi>when it can be nothing leſs) ought not to be puniſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="188" facs="tcp:102499:99"/>
            <p>If by <hi>Hereſie</hi> they mean, a ſecret though reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute electing or adhering to ſome <hi>Opinion</hi> or <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,</hi> contrary to ſome fundamental Article of <hi>Faith,</hi> or ſome duty of <hi>Religion,</hi> if they keep it ſecret, that no man hath cognizance of it, the Magiſtrate can neither judge it, nor puniſh it, for his Power reacheth only to <hi>external</hi> and manifeſt things.</p>
            <p>But <hi>open publication</hi> of this, defaming the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or any one Article of <hi>Faith,</hi> accompanied with an endeavour to gain <hi>Proſelytes</hi> to his Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Perſwaſion, this may be juſtly <hi>cenſured</hi> or <hi>puniſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Declared Hereſie,</hi> and <hi>open Schiſms,</hi> are of dreadful conſequence to diſturb the Peace of the whole Society.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> wiſhed, and not unlawful, if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate endeavour, <hi>they may be cut off that trouble it.</hi> For ſuch not only diſturb the Society in point of <hi>Piety,</hi> but in point of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> while they cauſe difference of pretended <hi>Judgment, Faith, Conſciences;</hi> upon which there muſt follow <hi>alienation</hi> of <hi>Affections,</hi> and <hi>Contentions,</hi> as hath been declared before ſufficiently.</p>
            <p>Now, if thoſe ſins that abuſe our <hi>Piety</hi> to God have as bad or worſe influences, for unhappy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, as the ſins that abuſe <hi>Charity</hi> to our Neighbours; why they ſhould have leſſer, or no <hi>puniſhment,</hi> it is beyond my narrow Reaſon to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.</p>

            <p>This then I poſitively affirm, and will not doubt to maintain, <hi>That Hereſie</hi> or <hi>Schiſme, when open and declared, and diſturbs the Peace of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, or any other manifeſt ſin, ought to have Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments determined and inflicted by Magiſtrates, by the Rules of the Goſpel.</hi> And I hope it will be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, what was ordered by thoſe Rules, may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be ordered by the Laws of Rulers to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>It is yet inſiſted on, <hi>Theſe things were not done by Chriſt or his Apoſtles. That Chriſt threatned woes and deſtruction to the unbelieving Jews is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably evident; and that as he threatned them, ſo upon their impenitence he inflicted them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True indeed, all the time of Chriſts Miniſtery and Humiliation, he did not manifeſt his Regal power, by <hi>inflicting</hi> Puniſhments, but only by <hi>threatning</hi> them upon ſuppoſed <hi>Diſobedience.</hi> But when Aſcended, taking upon him to be <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> he puniſhed the <hi>Rebellious;</hi> and the Judgments and ruine of the <hi>Jews</hi> muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to have come by the avenging Power of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As he threatned, ſo he cauſed the root of the Tree to wither for its unfruitfulneſs. For not returning <hi>Fruit</hi> when demanded of his <hi>Vineyard,</hi> he pulled down the Wall thereof, and it was trodden down. For killing the <hi>Heir,</hi> he miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſtroyed the <hi>Husbandmen.</hi> Becauſe <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> would not be gathered together under the <hi>Obedience</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> he cauſed their Houſe to be left unto them deſolate.</p>
            <pb n="190" facs="tcp:102499:100"/>
            <p>And ſure it cannot be ſuppoſed unlawful, if it be lone by Chriſtian Rulers upon <hi>open</hi> and <hi>obſtinate Tranſgreſſors,</hi> which was evidently done by Chriſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>And for the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> Though they were not Kings, yet they had Authority to cenſure and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thoſe that were <hi>obſtinately diſobedient,</hi> and they did exerciſe their Power wherewith they were intruſted to this end, when their <hi>Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication</hi> was oft attended with <hi>Temporal Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> to the deſtruction of the fleſh ſometimes, that the <hi>Soul</hi> might be ſaved.</p>
            <p>And who dare ſay, It is unjuſt for Rulers, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God, to do the like things, for the ſame Reaſons and End, which the extraordinary Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, given to the Apoſtles, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
            <p>One thing yet remains to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> That this was done upon <hi>Omiſſion</hi> or <hi>Recuſancy</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> to the Goſpel. And queſtionleſs ſo it was; for Chriſt (becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> would not know the time of his Viſitation in mercy) viſits them with <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> They rejected him and his Counſel, would not receive the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and therefore he ordered and brought deſtruction upon them.</p>
            <p>And thus was it done by the Apoſtles alſo, who for <hi>open ſins</hi> and <hi>diſobedience</hi> to Goſpel Rules, came not alway with ſpirits of <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> but ſometimes with a <hi>Rod.</hi> The <hi>obſtinate Offender</hi> was ordered to be Corrected that he might be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; ſometimes he was taken away from the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the <hi>Faithful,</hi> and delivered to Satan for the <hi>deſtruction of the Fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="191" facs="tcp:102499:100"/>
            <p>And, why ſhould it ſeem unjuſt for our Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates to order the like things, when by the Rules of the Goſpel, by the practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, <hi>Puniſhments</hi> may be determined and inflicted for <hi>wilful Omiſſion</hi> of Goſpel Duties, and manifeſt <hi>Diſobedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if any may, ſure I am Ours be, that are ordered and determined with ſo much tenderneſs and moderation, as all the World muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our Rulers deſigns are to amend their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and not deſtroy them. They ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves good Phyſicians, they love not many <hi>Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</hi> They had rather heal the diſtempered Member, than cut it off. They proceed ſlowly and rarely to mortal <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> only when the heinouſneſs of the Crimes exact them, and, if tolerated, would endanger the Peace of a great part of the Society. So that undoubtedly, the Clamours of <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> and <hi>Perſecution,</hi> when penal Statutes againſt <hi>Recuſants</hi> are execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as determined, can never be defended or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed.</p>
            <p>When that peaceable and quiet ſtate of the Church in the laſt Times, ſo oft commended, and promiſed, and deſired by us, was promiſed upon a condition of a <hi>Goſpel Obedience,</hi> and cannot in reaſon be expected upon Profeſſors <hi>wilful Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſancy,</hi> and <hi>open Diſobedience.</hi> Upon which, if any thing happens that is over-grievous and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to the Tranſgreſſor, let him blame himſelf, and not his Rulers; When, <hi>ſua voluntate obligat ſe ad poenam.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="192" facs="tcp:102499:101"/>
            <p>For when Laws are agreed upon ſoberly and deliberately; when publiſhed openly as moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient; when conſented unto by declared <hi>Vows</hi> and <hi>Subſcriptions,</hi> and when <hi>Puniſhments</hi> are fixed upon ſuppoſed Tranſgreſſion; the <hi>puniſhment</hi> happens by the <hi>Recuſants</hi> own election, for no man chooſeth ſuch a <hi>Tranſgreſſion,</hi> but chooſeth ſuch a <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> He had warning, knew the danger, and would run into it; His blood be upon his own head.</p>
            <p>Thus far we have reaſon, I hope, to conclude, <hi>That Puniſhments are juſtly inflicted as determined;</hi> It follows now we proceed to prove, <hi>That it is neceſſary to inflict Puniſhments, for the ſafety and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of our Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="193" facs="tcp:102499:101"/>
            <p>MAGISTRATES, whoſe Offices are to their utmoſt, to advance the Publick good of the Community in which they are intereſſed, can no way more effectually diſcharge their Duties, than by taking care of an impartial execution of <hi>diſtributive Righteouſneſs,</hi> rendring to every man the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence that is meet, according to the Merit of his work. And one eſſential part of this <hi>diſtributive Righteouſneſs,</hi> is, <hi>the juſt inflicting of Puniſhments upon thoſe obſtinate Offenders, who openly continue in evil doing.</hi> In our preſent State this is neceſſary for the welfare of this Society in which we live.</p>
            <p>That which evidently conduceth to the <hi>order</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> of our whole Nation, and without which all Orders of men are <hi>diſturbed</hi> and <hi>injured,</hi> muſt be granted to be neceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But without the juſt inflicting of Puniſhment as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, all Orders of Men are diſturbed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured.</hi> Ergo.</p>
            <p>And, <hi>That the omiſſion or neglect of a juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting of Penalties, as determined, hath an hurtful influence upon all Orders of Men</hi> (if we do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably deny our <hi>ſenſes</hi> and <hi>experience</hi>) we ſhall prove immediately.</p>
            <p n="1">1. With all ſubmiſſion we ſhall preſume to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, <hi>That an execution of Vindicative Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs makes the Rulers honourable, and without this, their Perſons become deſpicable, and their Authority contemptible.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="194" facs="tcp:102499:102"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Vindicative Righteouſneſs</hi> is the glory of a Ruler, it begets an awful <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> toward him from all his Subjects. The conſpicuity of this makes a man <hi>more excellent than his Neighbour.</hi> This made every ear that heard <hi>Job</hi> to bleſs him, and every eye to bear witneſs unto him, and every knee to bow to him, <hi>becauſe he broke the Jaws of the wicked, and plucked the Prey out of his Teeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without this <hi>Executing Vengeance,</hi> when Rulers are cool and indifferent, and connive at <hi>open ſins,</hi> it muſt create a <hi>ſuſpicion</hi> in others, that they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to countenance them; Men can hardly forbear to entertain <hi>low</hi> and <hi>diſhonourable</hi> thoughts of that Governour, when they ſee he takes no <hi>Vengeance</hi> upon the <hi>open Tranſgreſſor.</hi> They are ready to think, He is unworthily accounted above his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, who ſhews not his love to <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> by his <hi>open hatred</hi> to <hi>Wickedneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without this activity of the Ruler, he hath, for the moſt part among his People, the ſame fate the great <hi>Logg</hi> had that fell into the Lake among the <hi>Frogs;</hi> at its firſt fall they trembled and hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but at length obſerving it <hi>ſtupid</hi> and <hi>ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate,</hi> they crept up upon the top of it, and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultingly</hi> croaked over it. Like a <hi>Scarr-Crow,</hi> at whoſe firſt ſight <hi>hurtful Fowls</hi> flock about and wonder at it, but perceiving it <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>unaciive,</hi> then <hi>Terrour</hi> vaniſhes, and they impudently ſit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the top of it, and defile it.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>punitive Righteouſneſs</hi> exalts and renders <hi>Honourable,</hi> but <hi>Indulgence</hi> and <hi>Impunity</hi> of ſins
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:102499:102"/>are <hi>Reproaches</hi> to the Rulers of any People.</p>
            <p>Again, I humbly propound it to Honourable Rulers conſideration, That their <hi>Indulgence</hi> to any open ſin entitles them to the <hi>guilt</hi> of the ſame ſin; <hi>They have fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs, that do not reprove them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Poor Old <hi>Ely</hi> (good enough in other things for ought we read) by his <hi>Indulgence</hi> to his Sons ſins, contracts that <hi>guilt</hi> that he dreadfully ſuffered, for GOD, by his Prophet told him, <hi>That he had deſpiſed him, and ſet his Sons above him,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.29, 30. and by <hi>Samuel</hi> he is expreſsly told his <hi>Iniquity</hi> which he muſt know, viz. <hi>His Sons had made themſelves vile, and he reſtrained them not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, let this be ſeriouſly thought of, That he who <hi>acts a ſin</hi> may be catched ſuddenly in a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizal, through the prevalence of a <hi>Temptation;</hi> but, he that <hi>deliberately conſents to anothers acting,</hi> can hardly find a tolerable <hi>Excuſe. He is inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, who knowing the judgment of God (that they who commit ſuch things as are worthy of death) not only do the ſame, but take pleaſure in them that do them. Faciens &amp; Conſentiens eâdem lege tenentur: Qui tolerat aliena peccata cum tollere poteſt facit ſua.</hi> Religious Magiſtrates ought to take heed, that they do not make Rebellious mens ſins theirs, by <hi>Connivance</hi> or <hi>Indulgence,</hi> who have too many to anſwer for of their own.</p>
            <p>Again, as <hi>Indulgence</hi> in Rulers makes them guilty of <hi>ſin,</hi> ſo it makes them liable to the <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="196" facs="tcp:102499:103"/>
            <p>This is plain in good Old <hi>Ely</hi>'s caſe, his <hi>genthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>lenity</hi> to his Sons proved <hi>cruelty</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and made him the ſad object of the Anger of God; For God is known and honoured when <hi>Judgment</hi> is executed. And, <hi>they that honour him</hi> in this, <hi>ſhall be honoured; and whoſo deſpiſe</hi> this <hi>ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, what Ruler that is guilty of this ſin, in <hi>ſparing</hi> whom God would have puniſhed, but muſt tremble when he reads the Sentence of the Lord by his Prophet to <hi>Ahab,</hi> when he ſpared <hi>Benha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad?</hi> 1 Kings 20.42. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt let go a man out of thy hand, whom I appointed to utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; therefore thy life ſhall go for his life, and thy People for his People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I truly honour, but dare not flatter thoſe Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers God hath ſet over us; and therefore I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to put this into their remembrance, that <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration</hi> and <hi>ſuſpenſion of Penalties</hi> may be feared, and hereafter avoided by them; becauſe it is <hi>a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ſin, and dangerous for them not to inflict Puniſhments, as determined upon Recuſancy and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Diſobedience.</hi> He muſt remove the <hi>wicked</hi> from him, and ſcatter all <hi>evil</hi> with his Eye, that would have his Throne eſtabliſhed by <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As inflicting <hi>Puniſhments</hi> is neceſſary for the Governours, ſo for all their Subjects, for the <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors</hi> ſake, how grievous ſoever it may ſeem to him, yet it works for good. For if the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> be deſtructory it can but be of the <hi>Body</hi> only, and before that comes, <hi>time</hi> and <hi>helps</hi> are afforded, for working that <hi>Repentance</hi> which may be accepted,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:102499:103"/>ſo as the <hi>Soul</hi> we hope, by this means, may be ſaved.</p>
            <p>But moſt of our <hi>Puniſhments</hi> are <hi>caſtigatory,</hi> for amendment; and when (do we think) will the ſinner be <hi>amended,</hi> if never <hi>corrected.</hi> He will hardly be drawn off from his accuſtomed Iniquity, that ſees he can act it with <hi>Impunity.</hi> Becauſe <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is not executed, his heart is freely ſet upon his wickedneſs. But,
<q>Malo ſuo dedoceatur malus delinquere. <bibl>
                     <hi>Sen.</hi>
                  </bibl>
               </q> He is mad if he dotes and runs to that wickedneſs which he ſees hated and abominated, and will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be puniſhed. When he is ſharply reproved, he will be aſhamed.</p>
            <p>There is a <hi>Cruel mercy</hi> ſometimes in God and his Deputies which is to be feared, when they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to diſcover their <hi>Anger</hi> againſt Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; when they ſeem to be contented with their <hi>Deluſions,</hi> and ſuffer them to ſleep on, vainly and ſecurely, to their <hi>final deſtruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there is a diſcovery of <hi>Anger</hi> from both, which ought to be loved; when they hedge up the <hi>Tranſgreſſors</hi> way with Thorns; when by pains they awaken them out of their <hi>Lethargy,</hi> and will not ſuffer them to ſleep the <hi>ſleep of death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, when <hi>Indulgence</hi> and <hi>Impunity</hi> contribute to the ſinners deſtruction; <hi>executing of Judgments</hi> muſt be judged neceſſary, when they muſt conduce to the Tranſgreſſors <hi>amendment</hi> and <hi>ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Executing of Judgments</hi> is neceſſary for the

               <hi>Righteous mans ſake,</hi> without which he muſt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, he muſt be offended and troubled. <hi>When Wickedneſs triumphs and bears ſway, the righteous are ſad; but when Righteouſneſs rules, the godly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.

When it goes well with the <hi>Wicked,</hi> and <hi>they come in no misfortune like other men,</hi> the <hi>Holy man</hi> is prompted to think it is in vain he hath ſerved God, or made choice of any of his Waies. If there be any love in Rulers to the flouriſhing of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> they cannot give way to the indempnifying of <hi>Wickedneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Inflicting of Puniſhments</hi> on the Tranſgreſſors, helps on the <hi>Amendment</hi> of the whole Society.

            <p n="5">5. This is neceſſary to give a <hi>Reputation</hi> to our Laws, that they are juſtly and deliberately eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and have <hi>Penalties</hi> ſo affixed upon ſuppoſed <hi>Diſobedience.</hi> Our lives would be confuſed and uncomfortable without <hi>Laws,</hi> and Laws are vain and unprofitable without <hi>Execution.</hi> By this <hi>ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion</hi> we give ground to others to ſuſpect, that we our ſelves doubt and fear that our <hi>Laws</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined are <hi>needleſs</hi> if not <hi>unlawful.</hi> But if they

            <p n="6">6. This is neceſſary for the <hi>ſafety</hi> and <hi>welfare</hi> of the whole Nation.

            <p>But the <hi>Magiſtrates anger</hi> for Sins, turns away <hi>Gods Anger</hi> from a Nation; and the executing of Judgment by <hi>Man,</hi> diverts the Judgment of <hi>God.

            <p>I verily believe, <hi>Prejudice</hi> will keep off many from reading or conſidering theſe Truths, aſſerted and proved in this Treatiſe, becauſe they utterly deſtroy that <hi>wild Liberty</hi> and <hi>Indulgence</hi> which this Licentious Age ſo much affects.</p>
            <p>Some few of that Temper will read them, but diſreliſh them, and I think (what many do) very few will be reclaimed by them. But yet I comfort my ſelf, that my labour will not be in vain, if ſome of our wel-wiſhing Friends, of more <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Tempers,</hi> will deign the favour of a look upon theſe weak Endeavours. If they be not <hi>informed,</hi> yet they will be more fully <hi>confirmed,</hi> in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of thoſe Duties that are required at all our hands, when moſt agreeable to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Rules</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to our Reaſoning and Arguing, we muſt call in the <hi>Magiſtrates Sword</hi> to aſſiſt; all without this will be little effectual, to reduce that <hi>general <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> deſired, which will prove the beauty and glory both of this <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To you therefore I am conſtrained in this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, for our full Releif, to make my humble Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, that are our <hi>R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LERS,</hi> and in Authority, appointed by God for our good. It is evident your Concern by your Offices, is, to carry on this great deſign, and are not barely to have reſpect to the <hi>Notion,</hi> but to the <hi>Execution of Righteouſneſs;</hi> and ſo you are not only to animadvert ſeverely upon <hi>Tranſgreſſors,</hi> of <hi>moral, natural, neceſſary</hi> and <hi>divine Laws;</hi> but upon thoſe that break the <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, particular, human Ordinances,</hi> that you have
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:102499:106"/>in Your Wiſdom <hi>deliberately</hi> and <hi>juſtly</hi> eſtabliſhed among us.</p>
            <p>If perſons were ſo well diſpoſed, as <hi>Counſels</hi> or <hi>Monitions</hi> might perſwade all to be good, from the <hi>Pulpit</hi> or in the <hi>Cloſet,</hi> then no need to urge any Rigour from either <hi>Bench</hi> or <hi>Barr;</hi> but our unhappy Neceſſities require this at Your hands, who are Miniſters of <hi>Remunerative Juſtice,</hi> to ſhew your ſelves as well a <hi>Terrour to them that do evil,</hi> as a <hi>Countenance to them that do well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee what a lamentable ſucceſs your <hi>Lenity</hi> hath had hitherto, it muſt be <hi>Severity</hi> muſt do your buſineſs. Your method of leading this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, muſt be now like God leading his <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>Aegypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan:</hi> the Conduct muſt not be only as in the day, <hi>to lead them by a Cloud;</hi> but in this night it muſt be, <hi>by a Pillar of Fire.</hi> The eyes of theſe People have too long been daubed up with <hi>Hony,</hi> they muſt at laſt be opened with <hi>Gall:</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſuffer ſome ſmart and Cure them, than ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them, through <hi>blindneſs,</hi> to run headlong into the pit.</p>
            <p>Breath then at laſt, freſh life into the languiſhing <hi>Laws</hi> of a fainting Kingdom, by an <hi>impartial Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. Offer unto God the ſacrifice of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and take all care that <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> may be executed in the midſt of us. Remember, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> and <hi>Indulgence</hi> are Encouragements to the <hi>Tranſgreſſour;</hi> and <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Grievances</hi> to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you conceal and ſmother <hi>Diſorder;</hi> if you wink at <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> and countenance <hi>Diſobedience;</hi>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:102499:106"/>Oh, ſad Conſequences! both your <hi>ſelves</hi> and your <hi>wholſome Laws</hi> are diſhonoured and ſlighted. You are injurious to the <hi>Offender,</hi> while his heart is hardned, becauſe for his ſin he is not corrected: You offend the <hi>Righteous,</hi> when he is ſcandalized: You hurt your <hi>weak Neighbour,</hi> for he is ſtagger'd if not perverted: You hurt your own <hi>Souls,</hi> for you are perjured; yea, You are injurious to <hi>GOD,</hi> by Indulgence to <hi>Recuſancy;</hi> for his Worſhip is undervalued and contemned. For your <hi>own,</hi> for the <hi>Laws,</hi> for the <hi>Offenders,</hi> for the <hi>Righteous,</hi> for your <hi>weak Neighbour,</hi> for <hi>Religion,</hi> for <hi>Gods ſake,</hi> let there be no more halting, no longer conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance be found in the midſt of us. Execute true Judgment without <hi>partiality,</hi> and if we cannot have that <hi>Obedience</hi> to the Laws, which is juſtly required, let the Offender feel that juſt <hi>Vengeance</hi> which is threatned.</p>
            <p>Then, and not till then, we may hope to ſee the two ſtanding Ordinances, <hi>MAGISTRACY</hi> and <hi>MINISTERY,</hi> will be reverenced and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, which as yet are but mocked at and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed. Then we may hope, the Laws about the <hi>publick Exerciſe of Religion</hi> will find obligation and obſervance, which as yet are let looſe and weakned, and from too many meet with <hi>ſcorn</hi> and <hi>contempt.</hi> Then we ſhall once again ſee the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> openly profeſſed by every Believer, which now is concealed in moſt Congregations, as if men had cauſe thereof to be aſhamed. Then, and not till then, will the Church of <hi>England</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her attractive <hi>comlineſs</hi> and <hi>beauty,</hi> which
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:102499:107"/>is now much defaced and loathed. Then <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> the Glory of a Believing Nation, which hath been too long baniſht, will be brought back with joy into every Congregation. Then there will be no more running into Corners, but the Tribes of our <hi>Iſrael</hi> will unanimouſly go up to the <hi>Houſe of their God, unto their Teſtimony, to give thanks unto the Name of the LORD.</hi> Then ſhall God be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in all the Aſſemblies of his <hi>Saints,</hi> by <hi>open Confeſſion,</hi> which he knows is my earneſt endeavour and deſign, in my conſtant prayer in the Name of the Lord JESUS. <hi>To whom, with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, be glory and honour, now and for ever,</hi> Amen.</p>
